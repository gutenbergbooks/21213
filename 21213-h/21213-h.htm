    <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
      <p>In presenting a second monograph on the rural school problem in this series we
      register our sense of the importance of rural education. Too long have the rural
      schools suffered from neglect. Both the local communities and the State have
      overlooked the needs of the rural school system. At the present hour there is an
      earnest awakening of interest in rural life and its institutions. Already there is
      a small but certain movement of people toward the country and the vocation of
      agriculture. A period of agricultural prosperity, the reaction of men and women
      against the artificialities of city life, the development of farming through the
      application of science, and numerous other factors have made country life more
      congenial and have focused attention upon its further needs. It is natural,
      therefore, that the rural school should receive an increased share of
      attention.</p>
      <p>Educational administrators, legislators, and publicists have become aware of
      their responsibility to provide the financial support and the efficient
      organization that is needed to develop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi"
      id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> country schools. The more progressive of them are
      striving earnestly to provide laws that will aid rather than hamper the rural
      school system. In his monograph on <i>The Improvement of the Rural School</i>,
      Professor Cubberley has done much to interpret current efforts of this type. From
      the standpoint of state administration he has contributed much definite information
      and constructive suggestion as to how the State shall respond to the fundamental
      need for (1) more money, (2) better organization, and (3) real supervision for
      rural schools.</p>
      <p>It is not so clear, however, that rural patrons, school directors, and teachers
      have become fully aware of their duty in the matter of rural school improvement. To
      be sure much has been done by way of experiment in many rural communities; but it
      can scarcely be said that rural communities in general are thoroughly awake to the
      importance of their schools. The evidence to the contrary is cumulative. The first
      immediate need is to reawaken interest in the school as a center of rural life, and
      to suggest ways and means of transmuting this communal interest into effective
      institutional methods. To this end, Professor Betts has been asked to treat the
      rural school problem from a standpoint somewhat different<span class='pagenum'><a
      name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> from that assumed by Professor
      Cubberley; that is, from the point of view of the local community immediately
      related to, and concerned with, the rural school. In consequence his presentation
      emphasizes the things that ought to be done by the local authorities,&mdash;parent,
      trustee, and teacher. Its soundness may well be judged by the pertinent order of
      his discussion. Having stated his problem, he initiates his discussion by
      suggesting how the social relations of the school are to be reorganized; only later
      does he pass to the detail of curricula and teaching methods. It is a clear
      recognition of the fact that the community is the crucial factor in the making of a
      school. The State by sound fiscal and legislative policies may do much to make
      possible a better country school; but only the local authorities can realize it.
      The trained teacher with modern notions of efficiency may attempt to enlarge the
      curriculum and to employ newer methods of teaching, but his talents are useless if
      he is hampered by a conservative, unappreciative, and indifferent community. When
      the school becomes a social center of the community's interest and life, there will
      be no difficulty in achieving any policy which the State permits or which a skilled
      teacher urges. Scattered schools<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii"
      id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> will be consolidated, and isolated ungraded
      schools will be improved. Given an interested community, the modern teacher can
      vitalize every feature of the school, changing the formal curriculum into an
      interesting and liberalizing interpretation of country life and the pedantic drills
      and tasks of instruction into a skillful ministry to real and abiding human
      wants.</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
      <p>No rural population has yet been able permanently to maintain itself against the
      lure of the town or the city. Each civilization at one stage of its development
      comprises a large proportion of rural people. But the urban movement soon begins,
      and continues until all are living in villages, towns, and cities. Such has been
      the movement of population in all the older countries of high industrial
      development, as England, France, and Germany. A similar movement is at present
      going on rapidly in the United States.</p>
      <p>No great social movement ever comes by chance; it is always to be explained by
      deep-seated and adequate causes. The causes lying back of the rapid growth of our
      cities at the expense of our rural districts are very far from simple. They involve
      a great complex of social, educational, and economic forces. As the spirit of
      adventure and pioneering finds less to stimulate it, the gregarious impulse, the
      tendency to flock together for our work and our play, gains in ascendancy. Growing
      out of the greater intellectual opportunities and demands of modern<span
      class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> times, the
      standard of education has greatly advanced. And under the incentive of present-day
      economic success and luxury, comfortable circumstances and a moderate competence no
      longer satisfy our people. Hence they turn to the city, looking to find there the
      coveted social, educational, or economic opportunities.</p>
      <p>It is doubtful, therefore, whether, even with improved conditions of country
      life, the urbanization of our rural people can be wholly checked. But it can be
      greatly retarded if the right agencies are set at work. The rural school should be
      made and can be made one of the most important of these agencies, although at the
      present time its influence is chiefly negative. With the hope of offering some
      help, however slight, in adjusting the rural school to its problem, this little
      volume is written by one who himself belongs to the rural community by birth and
      early education and occupation.</p>

    <h3>THE RURAL SCHOOL AND ITS PROBLEM</h3>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span>
    <h4><i>The general problem of the rural school</i></h4>
    <p>The general problem of the rural school is the same as that of any other type of
    school&mdash;to render to the community the largest possible returns upon its
    investment in education with the least possible waste. Schools are great education
    factories set up at public expense. The raw material consists of the children of
    succeeding generations, helpless and inefficient because of ignorance and immaturity.
    The school is to turn out as its product men and women ready and able to take up
    their part in the great world of activities going on about them. It is in this way,
    in efficient education, that society gets its return for its investment in the
    schools.</p>
    <p>The word "education" has in recent years been taking on a new and more vital
    meaning. In earlier times the value of education was as<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>sumed, or vaguely taken on faith.
    Education was supposed to consist of so much "learning," or a given amount of
    "discipline," or a certain quantity of "culture." Under the newer definition,
    education may include all these things, but it must do more; it <i>must relate itself
    immediately and concretely to the business of living</i>. We no longer inquire of one
    how much he knows, or the degree to which his powers have been "cultivated"; but
    rather to what extent his education has led to a more fruitful life in the home, the
    state, the church, and other social institutions; how largely it has helped him to
    more effective work in a worthy occupation; and whether it has resulted in greater
    enjoyment and appreciation of the finer values of personal experience,&mdash;in
    short, whether for him education spells <i>efficiency</i>.</p>
    <p>We are thus coming to see that education must enable the individual to meet the
    real problems of actual experience as they are confronted in the day's life. Nor can
    the help rendered be indefinite, intangible, or in any degree uncertain. It must
    definitely adjust one to his place, and cause him to grow in it, accomplishing the
    most for himself and for society; it must add to the largeness of his personal life,
    and at the same time increase his working efficiency.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>
    <p>This is to say that one's education must (1) furnish him with the particular
    <i>knowledge</i> required for the life that he is to live, whether it be in the shop,
    on the farm, or in the profession. For knowledge lies at the basis of all efficiency
    and success in whatever occupation. Education must (2) shape the <i>attitude</i>, so
    that the individual will confront his part of the world's work or its play in the
    right spirit. It must not leave him a parasite, whether from wealth or from poverty,
    ready to prey upon others; but must make him willing and glad to do his share.
    Education must (3) also give the individual training in <i>technique</i>, or the
    skill required in his different activities; not to do this is at best but to leave
    him a well-informed and well-intentioned bungler, falling far short of
    efficiency.</p>
    <p>The great function of the school, therefore, is to supply the means by which the
    requisite <i>knowledge</i>, <i>attitude</i>, and <i>skill</i> can be developed. It is
    true that the child does not depend on the school alone for his knowledge, his
    attitude, and his skill. For the school is only one of many influences operating on
    his life. Much of the most vital knowledge is not taught in the school but picked up
    outside; a great part of the child's attitude toward life is formed through the
    rela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>tions of the
    home, the community, and the various other points of contact with society; and much
    of his skill in doing is developed in a thousand ways without being taught. Yet the
    fact remains that the school is organized and supported by society to make sure about
    these things, to see that the child does not lack in knowledge, attitude, or skill.
    They must not be left to chance; where the educative influences outside the school
    have not been sufficient, the school must take hold. Its part is to supplement and
    organize with conscious purpose what the other agencies have accomplished in the
    education of the child. The ultimate purpose of the school is <i>to make certain of
    efficiency</i>.</p>
    <p>The means by which the school is to accomplish these ends are (1) the <i>social
    organization</i> of the school, or the life and activities that go on in the school
    from day to day; (2) the <i>curriculum</i>, or the subject-matter which the child is
    given to master; and (3) the <i>instruction</i> or the work of the teacher in helping
    the pupils to master the subject-matter of the curriculum and adjust themselves to
    the organization of the school.</p>
    <p>These factors will of necessity differ, however, according to the particular type
    of school in question. It will therefore be necessary to inquire<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> into the special
    problem of the rural school before entering into a discussion of the means by which
    it is to accomplish its aim.</p>
    <h4><i>The special problem of the rural school</i></h4>
    <p>Each type of school has not only its general problem which is common to all
    schools, but also its special problem which makes it different from every other class
    of schools. The special problem of any type of school grows out of the nature and
    needs of the community which supports the school. Thus the city school, whose pupils
    are to live the industrial and social life of an urban community, confronts a
    different problem from that of a rural school, whose pupils are to live in a farming
    community. Each type of school must suit its curriculum, its organization, and its
    instruction to the demands to be met by its pupils. The knowledge taught, the
    attitudes and tastes developed, and the skill acquired must be related to the life to
    be lived and the responsibilities to be undertaken.</p>
    <p>The rural school must therefore be different in many respects from the town and
    city school. In its organization, its curriculum, and its spirit, it must be adapted
    to the requirements of the rural community. For, while many pupils from<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> the rural schools
    ultimately follow other occupations than farming, yet the primary function of the
    rural school is to educate for the life of the farm. It thus becomes evident that the
    only way to understand the problem of the rural school is first to understand the
    rural community. What are its industries, the character of its people, their economic
    status, their standards of living, their needs, their social life?</p>
    <p>The rural community is industrially homogeneous. There exists here no such a
    diversified mixture of industries as in the city. All are engaged in the same line of
    work. Agriculture is the sole occupation. Hence the economic interests and problems
    all center around this one line. The success or failure of crops, the introduction of
    a different method of cultivation or a new variety of grain, or the invention of an
    agricultural implement interests all alike. The farmer engaged in planting his corn
    knows that for miles around all other farmers are similarly employed; if he is
    cutting his hay or harvesting his grain, hundreds of other mowing machines and
    harvesters are at work on surrounding farms.</p>
    <p>This fund of common interest and experience tends to social as well as industrial
    homogeneity. Good-fellowship, social responsiveness and neigh<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>borliness rest on a basis of common labor,
    common problems, and common welfare. Like-mindedness and the spirit of
    co&ouml;peration are after all more a matter of similar occupational interests than
    of nationality.</p>
    <p>Another factor tending to make the rural community socially more homogeneous than
    the city community is its relatively stable population, and the fact that the stream
    of immigration is slow in reaching the farm. It is true that the European nations are
    well represented among our agricultural population; but for the most part they are
    not foreigners of the first generation. They have assimilated the American spirit,
    and become familiar with American institutions. The great flood of raw immigrants
    fresh from widely diverse nations stops in the large centers of population, and does
    not reach the farm.</p>
    <p>The prevailing spirit of democracy is still another influence favoring homogeneity
    in the rural community. Much less of social stratification exists in the country than
    in the city. Social planes are not so clearly defined nor so rigidly maintained.
    Financial prosperity is more likely to take the direction of larger barns and more
    acres than of social ostentation and exclusiveness.</p>
    <p>America has no servile and ignorant peasan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8"
    id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>try. The agricultural class constituting our rural
    population represents a high grade of natural intelligence and integrity. Great
    political and moral reforms find more favorable soil in the rural regions than in the
    cities. The demagogue and the "boss" find farmers impossible to control to their
    selfish ends. Vagabonds and idlers are out of place among them. They are a
    hard-headed, capable, and industrious class. As a rule, American farmers are
    well-to-do, not only earning a good living for their families, but constantly
    extending their holdings. Their farms are increasingly well improved, stocked, and
    supplied with labor-saving and efficient machinery. Their land is constantly growing
    in value, and at the same time yielding larger returns for the money and labor
    invested in it.</p>
    <p>The standard of living is distinctly lower in farm homes than in town and city
    homes of the same financial status. The house is generally comfortable, but small. It
    is behind the times in many easily accessible modern conveniences possessed by the
    great majority of city dwellers. The bath, modern plumbing and heating, the
    refrigerator, and other kindred appliances can be had in the country home as well as
    the city. Their lack is a matter of standards rather than<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> of necessity. They will be introduced
    into thousands of rural homes as soon as their need is realized.</p>
    <p>The possibilities for making the rural home beautiful and attractive are unequaled
    in the city for any except the very rich. It is not necessary that the farmhouse
    shall be crowded for space; its outlook and surroundings can be arranged to give it
    an &aelig;sthetic quality wholly impossible in the ordinary city home. That this is
    true is proved by many inexpensive farmhouses that are a delight to the eye. On the
    other hand, it must be admitted that a large proportion of farmhouses are lacking in
    both architectural attractiveness and environmental effect. Not infrequently the
    barns and sheds are so placed as to crowd the house into the background, and the
    yards for stock allowed to infringe upon the domain of the garden and the lawn. All
    this can be easily remedied and will be when the &aelig;sthetic taste of the dwellers
    on the farm comes to be offended by the incongruous and ugly.</p>
    <p>No stinting in the abundance of food is known on the farm. The farmer supplies the
    tables of the world, and can himself live off the fat of the land. Grains,
    vegetables, meats, eggs, butter, milk, and fruits are his stock in trade. If
    there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> is any
    lack in the farmer's table, it is due to carelessness in providing or preparing the
    food, and not to forced economy.</p>
    <p>While the farming population in general live well, yet many tables are lacking in
    variety, especially in fruit and vegetables. Time and interest are so taken up with
    the larger affairs of crops and stock, that the garden goes by default in many
    instances. There is no market readily at hand offering fruit and vegetables for sale
    as in the city, and hence the farm table loses in attractiveness to the appetite and
    in hygienic excellence. It is probable that the prosperous city workman sits down to
    a better table than does the farmer, in spite of the great advantage possessed by the
    latter.</p>
    <p>The population of rural communities is necessarily scattering. The nature of
    farming renders it impossible for people to herd together as is the case in many
    other industries. This has its good side, but also its bad. There are no rural slums
    for the breeding of poverty and crime; but on the other hand, there is an isolation
    and monotony that tend to become deadening in their effects on the individual. Stress
    and over-strain does not all come from excitement and the rush of competition; it may
    equally well originate in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg
    11]</a></span> lack of variety and unrelieved routine. How true this is is seen in
    the fact that insanity, caused in this instance chiefly by the stress of monotony,
    prevails among the farming people of frontier communities out of all proportion to
    the normal ratio.</p>
    <p>Farming is naturally the most healthful of the industrial occupations. The work is
    for the greater part done in the open air and sunshine, and possesses sufficient
    variety to be interesting. The rural population constitutes the high vitality class
    of the nation, and must be constantly drawn upon to supply the brain, brawn, and
    nerve for the work of the city. The farmer is, on the whole, prosperous; he is
    therefore hopeful and cheerful, and labors in good spirit. That so many farmers and
    farmers' wives break down or age prematurely is due, not to the inherent nature of
    their work, but to a lack of balance in the life of the farm. It is not so much the
    work that kills, as the <i>continuity of the work</i> unrelieved by periods of rest
    and recreation. With the opportunities highly favorable for the best type of
    healthful living, no inconsiderable proportion of our agricultural population are
    shortening their lives and lowering their efficiency by unnecessary over-strain and
    failure to conform to the most funda<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12"
    id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>mental and elementary laws of hygienic living,
    especially with reference to the relief from labor that comes through change and
    recreation.</p>
    <p>The rural community affords few opportunities for social recreations and
    amusements. Not only are the people widely separated from each other by distance, but
    the work of the farm is exacting, and often requires all the hours of the day not
    demanded for sleep. While the city offers many opportunities for choice of recreation
    or amusement, the country affords almost none. The city worker has his evenings,
    usually Saturday afternoon, and all day Sunday free to use as he chooses. Such is not
    the case on the farm; for after the day in the field the chores must be done, and the
    stock cared for. And even on Sunday, the routine must be carried out. The work of the
    farm has a tendency, therefore, to become much of a grind, and certainly will become
    so unless some limit is set to the exactions of farm labor on the time and strength
    of the worker. It separates the individual from his fellows in the greater part of
    the farm work and gives him little opportunity for social recreations or play.</p>
    <p>One of the best evidences that the conditions of life and work on the farm need to
    be improved is the number of people who are leaving the<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> farm for the city. This movement has
    been especially rapid during the last thirty years of our history, and has continued
    until approximately one half our people now live in towns or cities. Not only is this
    loss of agricultural population serious to farming itself, creating a shortage of
    labor for the work of the farm, but it results in crowding other occupations already
    too full. There is no doubt that we have too many lawyers, doctors, merchants,
    clerks, and the like for the number of workers engaged in fundamental productive
    vocations. Smaller farms, cultivated intensively, would be a great economic advantage
    to the country, and would take care of a far larger proportion of our people than are
    now engaged in agriculture.</p>
    <p>All students of social affairs agree that the movement of our people to towns and
    cities should be checked and the tide turned the other way. So important is the
    matter considered that a concerted national movement has recently been undertaken to
    study the conditions of rural life with a view to making it more attractive and so
    stopping the drain to the city.</p>
    <p>Middle-aged farmers move to the town or city for two principal reasons: to educate
    their children and to escape from the monotony of rural<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> life. Young people desert the farm for
    the city for a variety of reasons, prominent among which are a desire for better
    education, escape from the monotony and grind of the farm life, and the opportunity
    for the social advantages and recreations of the city. That the retired farmer is
    usually disappointed and unhappy in his town home, and that the youth often finds the
    glamour of the city soon to fade, is true. But this does not solve the problem. The
    flux to the town or city still goes on, and will continue to do so until the natural
    desire for social and intellectual opportunities and for recreation and amusement is
    adequately met in rural life.</p>
    <p>Farming as an industry has already felt the effects of a new interest in rural
    life. Probably no other industrial occupation has undergone such rapid changes within
    the last generation as has agriculture. The rapid advance in the value of land, the
    introduction of new forms of farm machinery, and above all the application of science
    to the raising of crops and stock, have almost reconstructed the work of the farm
    within a decade.</p>
    <p>Special "corn trains" and "dairy trains" have traversed nearly every county in
    many States, teaching the farmers scientific methods. Lectur<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>ers on scientific agriculture have
    found their way into many communities. The Federal Government has encouraged in every
    way the spread of information and the development of enthusiasm in agriculture. The
    agricultural schools have given courses of instruction during the winter to farmers.
    Farmers' institutes have been organized; corn-judging and stock-judging contests have
    been held; prizes have been offered for the best results in the raising of grains,
    vegetables, or stock. New varieties of grains have been introduced, improved methods
    of cultivation discovered, and means of enriching and conserving the soil devised.
    Stock-breeding and the care of animals is rapidly becoming a science. Farming bids
    fair soon to become one of the skilled occupations.</p>
    <p>Such, then, is a brief view of the situation of which the rural school is a part.
    It ministers to the education of almost half of the American people. This industrial
    group are engaged in the most fundamental of all occupations, the one upon which all
    national welfare and progress depend. They control a large part of the wealth of the
    country, the capital invested in agriculture being more than double that invested in
    manufactures. Agricultural wealth is rapidly increas<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>ing, both through the rise in the value
    of land and through improved methods of farming. The conditions of life on the farm
    have greatly improved during the last decade. Rural telephones reach almost every
    home; free mail delivery is being rapidly extended in almost every section of the
    country; the automobile is coming to be a part of the equipment of many farms; and
    the trolley is rapidly pushing out along the country roads.</p>
    <p>Yet, in spite of these hopeful tendencies, the rural community shows signs of
    deterioration in many places. Rural population is steadily decreasing in proportion
    to the total aggregate of population. Interest in education is at a low ebb, the farm
    children having educational opportunities below those of any other class of our
    people. For, while town and city schools have been improving until they show a high
    type of efficiency, the rural school has barely held its own, or has, in many places,
    even gone backward. The rural community confronts a puzzling problem which is still
    far from solution.</p>
    <p>Certain points of attack upon this problem are, however, perfectly clear and
    obvious. <i>First</i>, educational facilities must be improved for rural children,
    and their education be better adapted to farm life; <i>second</i>, greater
    opportunities must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg
    17]</a></span> provided for recreation and social intercourse for both young and old;
    <i>third</i>, the program of farm work must be arranged to allow reasonable time for
    rest and recreation; <i>fourth</i>, books, pictures, lectures, concerts, and
    entertainments must be as accessible to the farm as to the town. These conditions
    must be met, not because of the dictum of any person, but because they are a
    fundamental demand of human nature, and must be reckoned with.</p>
    <p>What, then, is the relation of the rural school to these problems of the rural
    community? How can it be a factor in their solution? What are its opportunities and
    responsibilities?</p>
    <h4><i>The adjustment of the rural school to its problem</i></h4>
    <p>As has been already stated, the problem of any type of school is to serve its
    constituency. This is to be done through relating the curriculum, the organization,
    and the teaching of the school to the immediate interests and needs of the people
    dependent on the school for their education. That the rural school has not yet fully
    adjusted itself to its problem need hardly be argued.</p>
    <p>It has as good material to work upon in the boys and girls from the farm as any
    type of schools<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg
    18]</a></span> in the country. They come of good stock; they are healthy and
    vigorous; and they are early trained to serious work and responsibility. Yet a very
    large proportion of these children possess hardly the rudiments of an education when
    they quit the rural school. Many of them go to school for only a few months in the
    year, compulsory education laws either being laxly enforced or else altogether
    lacking. A very small percentage of the children of the farm ever complete eight
    grades of schooling, and not a large proportion finish more than half of this
    amount.</p>
    <p>This leaves the child who has to depend on the rural school greatly handicapped in
    education. He has but a doubtful proficiency in the mechanics of reading, and has
    read but little. He knows the elements of spelling, writing, and number, but has
    small skill in any of them. He knows little of history or literature, less of music,
    nothing of art, and has but a superficial smattering of science. Of matters relating
    to his life and activities on the farm he has heard almost nothing. The rural child
    is not illiterate, but he is too close to the border of illiteracy for the demands of
    a twentieth-century civilization; it is fair neither to the child nor to society.</p>
    <p>The rural school seems in some way relatively<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> to have lost ground in our educational
    system. The grades of the town school have felt the stimulus of the high school for
    which they are preparing, and have had the care and supervision of competent
    administrators. The rural school is isolated and detached, and has had no adequate
    administrative system to care for its interests. No wonder, then, that certain grave
    faults in adjustment have grown up. A few of the most obvious of these faults may
    next claim our attention.</p>
    <p><i>The rural school is inadequate in its scope</i>. The children of the farm have
    as much need for education and as much right to it as those who live in towns and
    cities. Yet the rural school as a rule never attempts to offer more than the eight
    grades of the elementary curriculum, and seldom reaches this amount. It not
    infrequently happens that no pupils are in attendance beyond the fifth or the sixth
    grade. This may be due either to the small number of children in the district, or,
    more often, to lack of interest to continue in school beyond the simplest elements of
    reading, writing, and number. It is true that certain States, such as Illinois and
    Wisconsin, have established a system of township high schools, where secondary
    education equal to that to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
    20]</a></span> had in the cities is available to rural children. In other States a
    county high school is maintained for the benefit of rural school graduates. In still
    others, arrangements are made by which those who complete the eight grades of rural
    schools are received into the town high schools with the tuition paid by the rural
    school districts. The movement toward secondary education supplied by the rural
    community for its children is yet in its infancy, however, and has hardly touched the
    larger problem of affording adequate opportunities for the education of farm
    children.</p>
    <p><i>The grading and organization of the rural school is haphazard and faulty</i>.
    This is partly because of the small enrollment and irregular attendance, and partly
    because of the inexperience and lack of supervision of the teacher. Children are
    often found pursuing studies in three or four different grades at the same time. And
    even more often they omit altogether certain fundamental studies because they or
    their parents have a notion that these studies are unnecessary. Sometimes, owing to
    the small number in attendance, or to the poor classification, several grades are
    entirely lacking, or else they are maintained for only one or two pupils. On<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> the other hand,
    classes are often found following each other at an interval of only a few weeks,
    thereby multiplying classes until the teacher is frequently attempting the impossible
    task of teaching twenty-five or thirty classes a day. Children differing in age by
    five or six years, and possessing corresponding degrees of ability, are often found
    reciting in the same classes. That efficient work is impossible under these
    conditions is too obvious to require discussion.</p>
    <p><i>The rural schools possess inadequate buildings and equipment</i>. The average
    rural schoolhouse consists of one room, with perhaps a small hallway. The building is
    constructed without reference to architectural effect, resembling nothing so much as
    a large box with a roof on it. It is barren and uninviting as to its interior. The
    walls are often of lumber painted some dull color, and dingy through years of use.
    The windows are frequently dirty, and covered only by worn and tattered shades. There
    is usually no attempt to decorate the room with pictures, or to relieve its ugliness
    and monotony in any way. The library consists of a few dozens of volumes, not always
    supplied with a case for their protection. Of apparatus there is almost none. The
    work of the farm is done with efficient modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22"
    id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> equipment, the work of the farmer's school with
    inadequate and antiquated equipment.</p>
    <p>While the length of the school year is increasing in the rural districts, <i>the
    term is yet much shorter than in town and city schools</i>. Many communities have not
    more than six months of school, and few more than eight. This shortage is rendered
    all the more serious by the irregular attendance of the rural school children. A
    considerable amount of absence on the part of the younger ones is unavoidable under
    present conditions when the distance is great and the weather bad. After all
    allowance is made for this fact, however, there is still an immense amount of
    unnecessary waste of time through non-attendance. Many rural schools show an average
    attendance for the year of not more than sixty per cent of the enrollment. Going to
    school is not yet considered a serious business by many of the rural patrons, and
    truant officers are not so easily available in the country as in the city.</p>
    <p><i>In financial support the rural school has of necessity been behind the city
    school</i>. Wealth is not piled up on a small area in agricultural communities as is
    the case in the city. It would often require square miles of land to equal in value
    certain city blocks. But making full allowance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23"
    id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> for this difference, the farmers have not supported
    their schools as well as is done by the patrons of town and city schools. The school
    taxes for rural districts are much lower than in city districts, in most instances
    not more than half as high. It is this conservatism in expenditure that is
    responsible for many of the defects in the rural school, and particularly for the
    relatively inefficient teaching that is done. The rural teachers are the least
    educated, the least experienced, and the most poorly paid of any class of our
    teachers. They consist almost wholly of girls, a large proportion of whom are under
    twenty years of age, and who continue teaching not more than a year or two. Not only
    is this the case, but effective supervision of the teaching is wholly impossible
    because of the large area assigned to the county or district superintendent of rural
    schools. In no great industrial project should we think of placing our youngest and
    most inexperienced workers in the hardest and most important positions, and this
    without supervision of their work.</p>
    <p>The rural school has not, therefore, yet been adjusted to its problem. It has a
    splendid field of work, but is not developing it. Our farming population have
    capacity for education and need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24"
    id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> it, but they are not securing it. There is plenty of
    money available for the support of the rural school, but the school is not getting
    it. Enough well-equipped teachers can be had for the rural schools, but the standards
    have not yet required adequate preparation, nor the pay been sufficient to warrant
    extensive expenditure for it.</p>
    <p>In the rural school is found the most important and puzzling educational problem
    of the present day. If our agricultural population are not to fall behind other
    favored classes of industrial workers in intelligence and preparation for the
    activities that are to engage them, the rural school must begin working out a better
    adjustment to its problem. Its curriculum must be broader and richer, and more
    closely related to the life and interests of the farm. The organization of the
    school, both on the intellectual and the social side, must bring it more closely into
    touch with the interests and needs of the rural community. The support and
    administration of rural education must be improved. Teachers for the rural schools
    must be better educated and better paid, and their teaching must be correspondingly
    more efficient. The following pages will be given to a discussion of these problems
    of adjustment.</p>

    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
    <h3><b>THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE RURAL SCHOOL</b></h3>
    <p>Every school possesses two types of organization: (1) an <i>intellectual</i>
    organization involving the selection and arrangement of a curriculum, and its
    presentation through instruction; and (2) a <i>social</i> organization involving, on
    the one hand, the inter-relations of the school and the community, and on the other
    the relations of the pupils with each other and the teacher.</p>
    <h4><i>The rural school and the community</i></h4>
    <p>The rural school and community are not at present in vital touch with each other.
    The community is not getting enough from the school toward making life larger,
    happier, and more efficient; it is not giving enough to the school either in helpful
    co&ouml;peration or financial support.</p>
    <p>In general, it must be said that most of our rural people, the patrons of the
    rural school, have not yet conceived education broadly. They think<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> of the school as
    having fulfilled its function when it has supplied the simplest rudiments of reading,
    writing, and number. And, naturally enough, the rural school has conceived its
    function in the same narrow light; for it is controlled very completely by its
    patrons, and a stream cannot rise higher than its source.</p>
    <p>Because of its isolation, the pressing insistence of its toil, and the monotony of
    its environment, the rural community is in constant danger of intellectual and social
    stagnation. It has far more need that its school shall be a stimulating, organizing,
    socializing force than has the town or city. For the city has a dozen social centres
    entirely outside the school: its public parks, theatres, clubs, churches, and
    streets, even, serve to stimulate, entertain, and educate. But the rural community is
    wanting in all these social forces; it is lacking in both intellectual and social
    stimulus and variety.</p>
    <p>One of the most pressing needs of country districts is a common neighborhood
    center for both young and old, which shall stand as an organizing, welding,
    vitalizing force, uniting the community on a basis of common interests and
    activities. For while, as we have seen, the rural population as a whole are markedly
    homogeneous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
    there is after all but little of common acquaintanceship and mingling among them.
    Thousands of rural families live lives of almost complete social isolation and lack
    of contact with neighbors.</p>
    <p>This condition is one of the gravest drawbacks to farm life. The social impulse
    and the natural desire for recreation and amusement are as strong in country boys and
    girls as in their city cousins, yet the country offers young people few opportunities
    for satisfying these impulses and desires. The normal social tendencies of youth are
    altogether too strong to be crushed out by repression; they are too valuable to be
    neglected; and they are too dangerous to be left to take their own course wholly
    unguided. The rural community can never hope to hold its boys and girls permanently
    to the life of the farm until it has recognized the necessity for providing for the
    expression and development of the spontaneous social impulses of youth.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the social monotony and lack of variety of the rural community is a
    grave moral danger to its young people. It is a common impression that the great city
    is strewn thick with snares and pitfalls threatening to morals, but that the country
    is free from such temptations. The public dance halls and cheap theaters of the
    city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> are
    beyond doubt a great and constant menace to youthful ideals and purity. But the
    country, going to the opposite extreme, with its almost utter lack of recreation and
    amusement places, offers temptations no less insidious and fatal.</p>
    <p>The great difficulty at this point is that young people in rural communities are
    thrown together almost wholly in isolated pairs instead of in social groups; and that
    there are no objective resources of amusement or entertainment to claim their
    interest and attention away from themselves. They are freed from all chaperonage and
    the restraints of the conventions obtaining in social groups at the very time in
    their lives when these are most needed as steadying and controlling forces. The
    result is that the country districts, which ought to be of all places in the world
    the freest from temptation and peril to the morals of our young people, are really
    more dangerous than the cities. The sequel is found in the fact that a larger
    proportion of country girls than of city girls go astray. Nor is the rural community
    more successful in the morals of its boys than its girls. In other words, the lack of
    opportunities for free and normal social experience, the consequent ignorance of
    social conventions, and the absence of healthful amusement and recreation, make
    the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> rural
    community a most unsafe place in which to rear a family.</p>
    <p>But the necessity for social recreation and amusement does not apply to the young
    people alone. Their fathers and mothers are suffering from the same limitations,
    though of course with entirely different results. The danger here is that of
    premature aging and stagnation. While the toil of the city worker is relieved by
    change and variety, his mind rested and his mood enlivened by the stimulus from many
    lines of diversion, the lives of the dwellers on the farm are constantly threatened
    by a deadly sameness and monotony.</p>
    <p>The indisputable tendency of farmers and their wives to age so rapidly, and so
    early to fall into the ranks of "fogyism," is due far more to lack of variety and
    recreation and to dearth of intellectual stimulus than to hard labor, severe as this
    often is. Age is more than the flight of the years, the stoop of the form, or the
    hardening of the arteries; it is also the atrophy of the intellect and the fading
    away of the emotions resulting from disuse. The farmer needs occasionally to have
    something more exciting than the alternation of the day's work with the nightly
    "chores." And his wife should now and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30"
    id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> have an opportunity to meet people other than those
    for whom she cooks and sews.</p>
    <p>But what has all this to do with the social organization of the rural school?
    Much. The country cannot have its theaters, parks, and crowded thoroughfares like the
    city. But it needs and must have <i>some</i> social center, where its people may
    assemble for recreation, entertainment, and intellectual growth and development. And
    what is more natural and feasible than that the public school should be this center?
    Here is an institution already belonging to the whole people, and set apart for the
    intellectual training of the young. Why should it not also be made to minister to the
    intellectual needs of their elders as well, and to the social needs of all? <i>Why
    should not the public school building, now in use but six hours a day for little more
    than half the year, be open at all times when it can be helpful to any portion of the
    community?</i></p>
    <p>If young people are to develop naturally, if they are to make full use of their
    social as well as their intellectual powers, if they are to be satisfied with their
    surroundings, they must be provided with suitable opportunities for social mingling
    and recreation in groups. This is nature's way; there is no other way. The
    school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> might
    and should afford this opportunity. There is not the least reason why the school
    building, when it is adapted to this purpose, should not be the common neighborhood
    meeting place for all sorts of young people's parties, picnics, entertainments,
    athletic contests, and every other form of amusement approved in the community.</p>
    <p>Such a use of the school property would yield large returns to the community for
    the small additional expense required. It would serve to weld the school and
    community more closely together. It would vastly change the attitude of the young
    toward the school. It would save much of the dissatisfaction of young people with the
    life of the farm. It would prove a great safeguard to youthful morals. It would lead
    the community itself to a new sense of its duty toward the social life of the young,
    and to a new concept of the school as a part of the community organization. Finally,
    this broadened service of the school to its community would have a reflex influence
    on the school itself, vitalizing every department of its activities, and giving it a
    new vision of its opportunities.</p>
    <p>The first obstacle that will appear in the way of such a plan is the inadequacy of
    the present type of country schoolhouse. And this is a seri<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ous matter; for the barren, squalid
    little building of the present day would never fit into such a project. But this type
    of schoolhouse must go&mdash;is going. It is a hundred years behind our civilization,
    and wholly inadequate to present needs. Passing for later discussion the method by
    which these buildings are to be supplanted by better ones, let us consider further
    the details of the plan of making the school the neighborhood center.</p>
    <p>First of all, each school must supply a larger area and a greater number of people
    than at present. It is financially impossible to erect good buildings to the number
    of our present schools. Nor are there pupils enough in the small district as now
    organized to make a school, nor people enough successfully to use the school as a
    neighborhood center.</p>
    <p>Let each township, or perhaps somewhat smaller area, select a central,
    well-adapted site and thereon erect a modern, well-equipped school building. But this
    building must not be just the traditional schoolhouse with its classrooms and rows of
    desks. For it is to be more than a place where the children will study and recite
    lessons from books; it is to be the place where all the people of the neighborhood,
    <i>old and young</i>, will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
    33]</a></span> assemble for entertainment, amusement, and instruction. Here will be
    held community picnics, social entertainments, young people's parties, lectures,
    concerts, debating contests, agricultural courses for the farmers, school programs,
    spreads and banquets, and whatever else may belong to the common social and
    intellectual life of the community.</p>
    <p>The modern rural school building will therefore be home-like as well as
    school-like. In addition to its classrooms it will contain an assembly room capable
    of seating several hundred people. The seating of this room may be removable so that
    the floor can be cleared for social purposes or the room used for a dining-room. One
    or two smaller rooms will be needed for social functions, club and committee
    meetings. These rooms should be made attractive with good furniture, rugs, couches,
    and pictures. The building will contain well-equipped laboratories for manual
    training and domestic science, the latter of which will be found serviceable in
    connection with serving picnics, "spreads," and the like. The entire building should
    be architecturally attractive, well heated and ventilated, commodious, well
    furnished, and decorated with good pictures. In it should be housed a library
    con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>taining
    several thousand well-selected books, besides magazines and newspapers. The
    laboratories and equipment should be fully equal to those found in the town schools,
    but should be adapted to the work of the rural school.</p>
    <p>The grounds surrounding the rural school building can easily be ample in area, and
    beautiful in outlook and decoration. Here will be the neighborhood athletic grounds
    for both boys and girls, shade trees for picnics, flowers and shrubs, and ground
    enough for a school garden connected with the instruction in agriculture. Nor is it
    too much to believe that the district will in the future erect on the school grounds
    a cottage for the principal of the school and his family, and thus offer an
    additional inducement for strong, able men to devote their energies to education in
    the rural communities.</p>
    <p>Now contrast this schoolhouse and equipment with the typical rural building of the
    present. Adjoining a prosperous farm, with its large house, its accompanying barns,
    silos, machine houses, and all the equipment necessary to modern farming, is the
    little schoolhouse. It is a dilapidated shell of a rectangular box, barren of every
    vestige of beauty or attractiveness both inside and out. At the rear are two
    outbuildings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
    which are an offense to decency and a menace to morals. Within the schoolhouse the
    painted walls are dingy with smoke and grime. The windows are broken and dirty, no
    pictures adorn the walls. The floor is washed but once or twice a year. The room is
    heated by an ugly box of a stove, and ventilated only by means of windows which
    frequently are nailed shut. The grounds present a wilderness of weeds, rubbish, and
    piles of ashes. It is all an outrage against the rights of the country child, and an
    indictment of the intelligence and ideals of a large proportion of our people.</p>
    <p>If it is said that the plan proposed to remedy this situation is revolutionary, it
    will be admitted. What our rural schools of to-day need is <i>not improvement but
    reorganization</i>. For only in this radical way can they be made a factor in the
    vitalizing and conserving of the rural community which, unless some new leaven is
    introduced, is surely destined to disorganization and decay.</p>
    <h4><i>The consolidation of rural schools</i></h4>
    <p>The first step in reorganizing the rural schools is <i>consolidation</i>. Our
    rural school organization, buildings, and equipment are a full century behind our
    industrial and social advancement. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36"
    id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> present plan of attempting to run a school on
    approximately every four square miles of territory originated at a time of poverty,
    and when the manufacturing industries were all carried on in the homes and small
    shops. Our rural people are now well-to-do, and manufacturing has moved over into a
    well-organized set of factories; but the isolated little school, shamefully housed,
    meagerly equipped, poorly attended, and unskillfully taught, still remains.</p>
    <p>Such a system of schools leaves our rural people educationally on a par with the
    days of cradling the grain and threshing it with a flail; of planting corn by hand
    and cultivating it with a hoe; of lighting the house with a tallow dip, and traveling
    by stage-coach.</p>
    <p>The well-meant attempts to "improve" the rural school as now organized are futile.
    The proposal to solve the problem by raising the standards for teachers, desirable as
    this is; by the raising of salaries; or by bettering the type of the little
    schoolhouse, are at best but temporary makeshifts, and do not touch the root of the
    problem. The first and most fundamental step is to eliminate the little shacks of
    houses that dot our prairies every two miles along the country roads.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
    <p>For not only is it impossible to supply adequate buildings so near together, but
    it is even more impossible to find children enough to constitute a real school in
    such small districts. There is no way of securing a full head of interest and
    enthusiasm with from five to ten or twelve pupils in a school. The classes are too
    small and the number of children too limited to permit the organization of proper
    games and plays, or a reasonable variety of association through mingling
    together.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it will never be possible to pay adequate salaries to the teachers in
    these small schools. Nor will any ambitious and well-prepared teacher be willing to
    remain in such a position, where he is obliged to invest his time and influence with
    so few pupils, and where all conditions are so adverse.</p>
    <p>The chief barrier to the centralization of rural education has been local
    prejudice and pride. In many cases a true sentimental value has attached to "the
    little red schoolhouse." Its praises have been sung, and orator and writer have
    expanded upon the glories of our common schools, until it is no wonder that their
    pitiful inadequacy has been overlooked by many of their patrons.</p>
    <p>In other cases opposition has arisen to giving<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> up the small local school because of
    the selfish fear that the loss of the school would lower the value of adjacent
    property. Still others have feared that consolidation would mean higher school taxes,
    and have opposed it upon this ground.</p>
    <p>But whatever the causes of the opposition to consolidation, this opposition must
    cease before the rural school can fulfill its function and before the rural child can
    have educational opportunities even approximating those given the town child. And
    until this is accomplished, the exodus from the farm will continue and ought to
    continue. Pride, prejudice, and penury must not be allowed to deprive the farm boys
    and girls of their right to education and normal development.</p>
    <p>The movement toward consolidation of rural schools and transportation of the
    children to a central school has already attained considerable headway in many
    regions of the country.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is now a part of the rural school
    system in thirty-two States. Massachusetts, the leader in consolidation, began in
    1869. The movement at first grew slowly in all the States, not only having local
    opposition to overcome, but also meeting the problem of bad country roads interfering
    with the transportation of pupils.</p>
    <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>During the
    past half-dozen years, however, consolidation has been gaining headway, and is now
    going on at least five times as fast as the average for the twenty-five years
    preceding 1906. Indiana is at present the banner State in the rapidity of
    consolidation, the expenditure for conveyance having considerably more than trebled
    since 1904. The broad and general sweep of the movement, together with the fact that
    it is practically unheard of for schools that have once tried consolidation to go
    back to the old system, seems to indicate that the rural education of the not distant
    future will, except in a few regions, be carried on in consolidated schools.</p>
    <p>The relative cost of maintaining district and consolidated schools is an important
    factor. Yet this factor must not be given undue prominence. It is true that the cost
    of education must be kept at a reasonable ratio with the standard of living of a
    community. But it is also true that the consolidated rural school must be looked upon
    as an indispensable country-life institution, and hence as having claim to a more
    generous basis of support than that accorded the district school.</p>
    <p>While it is impossible, owing to such widely<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> varying conditions, to make an
    absolutely exact statement of the relative expense of the two types of schools, yet
    it has been shown in many different instances that the cost of schooling per day in
    consolidated schools is but slightly, if any, above that in most district
    schools.</p>
    <p>The aggregate annual cost is usually somewhat higher in the consolidated schools,
    owing to the fact of a greatly increased attendance. A comparison made between the
    cost per day's schooling in the smaller district schools and consolidated schools
    almost invariably shows a lower expenditure for the latter. For example, the fifteen
    districts in Hardin County, Iowa, having in 1908 an enrollment of nine or less,
    averaged a cost of 27.5 cents a day for each pupil.<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
    id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At the same
    time the cost per day in the consolidated rural schools of northeastern Ohio was only
    17.4 cents a day, the district schools being more than fifty-seven per cent higher
    than the consolidated. Similar comparisons show the same trend in many other
    localities. In a great many of the small district schools the cost per pupil is as
    high as in consolidated schools where a high school course is also provided. It has
    been found that the average cost per year of schooling a child in a con<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>solidated school is
    but little above thirty dollars, while in practically all smaller district schools it
    far exceeds this amount, not infrequently going above fifty dollars. This means that
    average rural districts that are putting at least thirty dollars a year into the
    schooling of each child can, by consolidating their schools, secure greatly improved
    educational facilities with no heavier financial burden.</p>
    <p>Not the least important of the advantages growing out of rural school
    consolidation is the improved attendance. Experience has shown that fully twenty-five
    per cent more children of school age are enrolled under the consolidated than under
    the district system. The advantage of this one factor alone can hardly be
    over-estimated, but the increase in regularity of attendance is also as great. The
    average daily attendance of rural schools throughout the country is approximately
    sixty per cent of the enrollment, and in entire States falls below fifty per cent. It
    has been found that consolidation, with its attendant conveyance of pupils, commonly
    increases the average daily attendance by as much as twenty-five per cent.</p>
    <p>It is true that in many regions it may at present prove impossible to consolidate
    all the rural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
    schools. In places where the population is so sparse as to require transportation for
    very long distances, or where the country roads are still in such a condition in wet
    seasons as to be practically impassable, consolidation must of necessity be delayed.
    In such communities, however, the rural school need not be completely at a
    standstill. Much can be done to make even the one-room schoolhouse attractive and
    hygienic. With almost no expense, the grounds can be set with shade trees, shrubs,
    and perennial flowering plants. The yard can be made into a lawn in front, and into
    an athletic ground at the sides or the rear. Enough ground can be added to provide
    for all these things, and a school garden besides. The building can be rendered more
    inviting through better architecture, and more attention to decoration and
    cleanliness. An adequate supply of books and other equipment can be provided. While
    the isolated rural school can never take the place of the consolidated school, while
    it should always be looked upon as only temporarily occupying a place later to be
    filled by a more efficient type of school, it can after all be rendered much more
    efficient than it is at present. And since the one-room school will without doubt for
    years to come be required as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43"
    id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> supplement of the consolidated school, it should
    receive the same careful thought and effort toward its improvement that is being
    accorded the school of better type.</p>
    <h4><i>Financial support of the rural school</i></h4>
    <p>The rural school has never had adequate financial support. There has been good
    reason for this in many regions of the country where farm property was low in value,
    the land sparsely settled and not all improved, or else covered by heavy mortgages.
    As these conditions have gradually disappeared and the agricultural population become
    more prosperous, the school has in some degree shared the general prosperity. But not
    fully. A smaller proportion of the margin of wealth above living necessities is going
    into rural education now than in the earlier days of less prosperity. While the
    farmer has vastly "improved" his farm, he has improved his school but little. While
    he has been adding modern machinery and adopting scientific methods in caring for his
    grain and stock, his children have not had the advantage of an increasingly efficient
    school.</p>
    <p>The poverty of the rural school finds its explanation in two facts: (1) the
    relatively low value<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg
    44]</a></span> of the taxable property of the rural as compared with the town or city
    district, and (2) the lower rate of local school tax paid in country than in urban
    districts. The first of these disadvantages of the rural district cannot be remedied;
    but for the second, there seems to be no valid economic reason.</p>
    <p>The approximate difference in the local school-tax rate paid in urban and rural
    districts is shown in the following instances, which might be duplicated from other
    States:&mdash;</p>
    <p>In Kansas, the local school tax paid in 1910 by towns and cities was above eighty
    per cent more than that paid by country districts. In Missouri, the current report of
    the State Superintendent shows towns and cities seventy-five per cent higher than the
    country. In Minnesota, towns and cities average nearly three times the rate paid by
    rural districts. In Ohio, towns and cities are more than ten per cent higher than
    rural districts, even where the rural district maintains a full elementary and high
    school course. In Nebraska and Iowa, the town and city rate is about double that of
    country districts.</p>
    <p>When there is added to this difference the further fact that town and city
    property is commonly assessed at more nearly its full value than<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> rural property, the
    discrepancy becomes all the greater.</p>
    <p>It is not meant, of course, that farmers should pay as high a school-tax rate for
    the elementary rural school as that paid by town patrons who also have a high school
    available. But, on the other hand, if better school facilities are to be furnished
    the country children, rural property should bear its full share of the taxes
    required. The farmer should be willing to pay as much for the education of his child
    as the city dweller pays for a similar education for his.</p>
    <p>During the last generation farmers have been increasing in wealth faster than any
    other class of industrial workers. Their land has doubled in value, barns have been
    built, machinery has been added, automobiles purchased, and large bank credits
    established. Yet very little of this increased prosperity has reached the school.
    Library, reference works, maps, charts, and other apparatus are usually lacking. In
    Iowa, as a fair example, a sum of not less than ten nor more than fifteen cents a
    year for each pupil of school age in the district is required by law to be expended
    for library books. Yet in not a few districts the law is a dead letter or the money
    grudgingly spent! In many rural schools the teacher<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> has to depend on the proceeds of a
    "social," an "exhibition," or a "box party" to secure a few dollars for books or
    pictures for the neighborhood school, and sometimes even buys brooms and dust pans
    from the fund secured in this way.</p>
    <p>This is all wrong. The school should be put on a business basis. It should have
    the necessary tools with which to accomplish its work, and not be forced to waste the
    time and opportunity of childhood for want of a few dollars expended for equipment.
    Its patrons should realize that just as it pays to supply factory, shop, or farm with
    the best of instruments for carrying on the work, so it pays in the school. Cheap
    economy is always wasteful, and never more wasteful than when it cripples the
    efficiency of education.</p>
    <p>State aid for rural schools has been proposed and in some instances tried, as a
    mode of solving their financial problem. Where this system has been given a fair
    trial, as for example in Minnesota, it has resulted in two great advantages: (1) it
    has encouraged the local community to freer expenditure of their own money for school
    purposes, since the contribution of the State is conditioned on the amount expended
    by the district. This is an important achievement, since it serves to train the
    community to the idea of more liberal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47"
    id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> local taxation for school purposes, and it is
    probable that the greater part of the support of our schools will continue to come
    from this source. Another advantage of state aid is (2) that it serves to equalize
    educational opportunities, and hence to maintain a true educational democracy.
    Wealthier localities are caused to contribute to the educational facilities of those
    less favored, and a common advancement thereby secured.</p>
    <p>While the theory of state aid to rural education is wholly defensible, and while
    it has worked well in practice, yet there is one safeguard that needs to be
    considered. It is manifestly unfair to ask the people of towns and cities to help pay
    for the support of the rural schools through the medium of the State treasury except
    on condition that the patrons of the rural schools themselves do their fair share.
    Mr. "A," living in a town where he pays twenty mills school tax, ought not to be
    asked to help improve Mr. "B's" rural school, while Mr. "B" is himself paying but ten
    mills of school tax. The farmer is as able as any one else to pay a fair rate of
    taxation for his school, and should be willing to do so before asking for aid from
    other taxation sources. Rural education must not be placed on the basis of a
    missionary enterprise. State aid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48"
    id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> should be used to compensate for the difference in
    the economic <i>basis</i> for taxation in different localities, and not for a
    difference in the <i>rates</i> of taxation between localities equally able to pay the
    same rate.</p>
    <br />

    <p>We may conclude, then, that while neither the rural school nor the community has
    been fully aware of the possibilities for mutual helpfulness and co&ouml;peration,
    yet there are many hopeful signs that both are awakening to a sense of
    responsibility. Federal and state commissions have been created to study the rural
    problem, national and state teachers' associations are seeking a solution of the
    rural school question, and, better still, the patrons of the rural schools are in
    many places alive to the pressing need for better educational facilities for their
    children.</p>
    <p>Growing out of these influences and the faithful work of many state and county
    superintendents, and not a few of the rural teachers themselves, a spirit of progress
    is gaining headway. Several thousand consolidated schools are now rendering excellent
    service to their patrons and at the same time acting as a stimulus to other
    communities to follow their example. State aid to rural education is no longer an
    experiment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
    The people are in many localities voluntarily and gladly increasing their taxes in
    order that they may improve their schools. Teachers' salaries are being increased,
    better equipment provided, and buildings rendered more habitable.</p>
    <p>The great educational problem of the immediate future will be to encourage and
    guide the movement which is now getting under way. For mistakes made now will
    handicap both community and school for years to come. The attempt to secure better
    schools by "improving" conditions in local districts should be definitely abandoned
    except in localities where conditions make consolidation impracticable for the
    present. The new consolidated school building should take definitely into account the
    fact that the school is to become the <i>neighborhood social center</i>, and the
    structure should be planned as much with this function in view as with its uses for
    school purposes. The new type of rural school is not to aim simply to give a better
    intellectual training, but is at the same time to relate this training to the
    conditions and needs of our agricultural population. And all who have to do with the
    rural schools in any way are to seek to make the school a true vitalizing factor in
    the community&mdash;a leaven, whose influence shall permeate every<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> line of interest
    and activity of its patrons and lead to a fuller and richer life.</p>
    <h4><i>The rural school and its pupils</i></h4>
    <p>One of the surest tests of any school is the attitude of the pupils&mdash;the
    spirit of loyalty, co&ouml;peration, and devotion they manifest with reference to
    their education. Do they, on the whole, look upon the school as an opportunity or an
    imposition? Do they consider it <i>their</i> school, and make its interests and
    welfare their concern, or do they think of it as the teacher's school, or the board's
    school or the district's school? These questions are of supreme importance, for the
    question of attitude, quite as much as that of ability, determines the use made of
    opportunity.</p>
    <p>It must be admitted that throughout our entire school system there remains
    something to be desired in the spirit of co&ouml;peration between pupils and schools.
    The feeling of loyalty which the child has for his home does not extend
    commensurately to the school. Too often the school is looked upon as something forced
    upon the child, for his welfare, perhaps, but after all not as forming an interesting
    and vital part of his present experience. It is often rather a place where so much
    time and effort and inconven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg
    51]</a></span>ience must be paid for so many grades and promotions, and where,
    incidentally, preparation is supposed to be made for some future demands very dimly
    conceived. At best, there is frequently a lack of feeling of full identity of
    interests between the child and the school.</p>
    <p>The youth, immaturity, and blindness of childhood make it impossible, of course,
    for children to conceive of their school in a spirit of full appreciation. On the
    other hand, the very nature of childhood is responsiveness and readiness of
    co&ouml;peration in any form of interesting activity,&mdash;is loyalty of attitude
    toward what is felt to minister to personal happiness and well-being. In so far,
    therefore, as there exists any lack of loyalty and co&ouml;peration of pupils toward
    their school, the reasons for such defection are to be sought first of all in the
    school, and not in the child.</p>
    <p>While this negative attitude of the pupils exists in some degree in all our
    schools, it is undoubtedly more marked in our rural schools than in others. In a
    negligible number of cases does this lack of co&ouml;peration take the form of overt
    rebellion against the authority of the school. It is manifested in other ways, many
    of them wholly unconscious to the child, as, for example,<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> lack of desire to attend school, and
    indifference to its activities when present.</p>
    <p>Attending school is the most important occupation that can engage the child. Yet
    the indifference of children and their parents alike to the necessity for schooling
    makes the small and irregular attendance of rural school pupils one of the most
    serious problems with which educators have to deal. County superintendents have in
    many places offered prizes and diplomas with the hope of bettering attendance, but
    such incentives do not reach the source of the difficulty. The remedy must finally
    lie in a fundamental change of attitude toward the school and its opportunities. Good
    attendance must spring from interest in the school work and a feeling of its value,
    rather than from any artificial incentives.</p>
    <p>How great a problem poor attendance at rural schools is, may be realized from the
    fact that, in spite of compulsory education laws, not more than seventy per cent of
    the children accessible to the rural school are enrolled, and of this number only
    about sixty per cent are in daily attendance. This is to say that under one half of
    our farm children are daily receiving the advantages of even the rural school. In
    some States this proportion will fall as low as three tenths instead<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> of one half. In
    many rich agricultural counties of the Middle West, having a farming population of
    approximately ten thousand, not more than forty or fifty pupils per year complete the
    eight grades of the rural school.</p>
    <p>If the rural school is to be able to claim the regular attendance and spontaneous
    co&ouml;peration of the children it must (1) be reasonably accessible to them, (2) be
    attractive and interesting in itself, and (3) offer work the value and application of
    which are evident.</p>
    <p>The inaccessibility of the rural school has always been one of its greatest
    disadvantages. In a large proportion of cases, a walk of from a mile to a mile and a
    half along country roads or across cultivated fields has been required to reach the
    schoolhouse. During inclement weather, or when deep snow covers the ground, this
    distance proves almost prohibitive for all the smaller children. Wet feet and
    drenched clothing have been followed by severe colds, coughs, bronchitis, or worse,
    and the children have not only suffered educationally, but been endangered physically
    as well.</p>
    <p>It has been found in all instances that public conveyance of pupils to the
    consolidated schools greatly increases rural school patronage. It makes<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> the school
    accessible. The regular wagon service does away with the "hit-and-miss" method of
    determining for each succeeding day whether it is advisable for the child to start
    for school. So important is this factor in securing attendance, that a careful study
    by Knorr<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
    class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the attendance in Ohio district and consolidated schools
    shows twenty-seven per cent more of the total school population in school under the
    influence of public conveyance and other features peculiar to consolidation than
    under the district system. He concludes that, broadly speaking, by a system of
    consolidated schools with public conveyance, rural school attendance can be increased
    by at least one fourth.</p>
    <p>The life in the typical rural school is not sufficiently interesting and
    attractive to secure a strong hold upon the pupils. The dreary ugliness of the
    physical surroundings has already been referred to. And even in districts where the
    building and grounds have been made reasonably attractive, there is yet wanting a
    powerful factor&mdash;the influence of the social incentive that comes from numbers.
    In hundreds of our rural schools the daily attendance is less than a dozen pupils,
    frequently not representing more than three or four families. The classes can
    therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
    contain not more than two or three pupils, and often only one. There is no
    possibility of organizing games, or having the fun and frolic possible to larger
    groups of children. Add to this the fact that the teaching is often spiritless and
    uninspiring, and the reason becomes still more plain why so many rural children drop
    out of school with scarcely the rudiments of an education.</p>
    <p>Here, again, the consolidated school, with its attractive building, its improved
    equipment, its larger body of pupils, and its better teaching, appears as a solution
    of the difficulty. For it does what the present type of district school can never
    do&mdash;it makes school life interesting and attractive to its pupils, and this
    brings to bear upon them one of the strongest incentives to continue in school and
    secure an education.</p>
    <p>Finally, much of the work of the school has not appealed to the pupils as
    interesting or valuable. This has not been altogether the fault of the curriculum,
    but often has come from the lack of adaptability of the work to the pupils studying
    it. Through frequent changes of teachers, poor classification, and irregularity of
    attendance, rural pupils have often been forced to go over and over the same ground,
    without any reference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg
    56]</a></span> to whether they were ready to advance or not. In other cases, careless
    grading has placed children in studies for which they were utterly unprepared, and
    from which they could get nothing but discouragement and dislike for school. In still
    other instances the course pursued has been ill-balanced, and in no degree
    correlated. Often the whim of the child determines whether he will or will not study
    certain subjects, the teacher lacking either the knowledge or insistence to bring
    about a better organization of the work.</p>
    <p>The unskilled character of the rural school-teaching force, and the impossibility
    of securing any reasonable supervision as the system is at present organized, make us
    again turn to the consolidated school as the remedy for these adverse conditions. For
    with its improved attendance, its skilled teaching, and its better supervision, it
    easily and naturally renders such conditions impossible. Give the consolidated
    school, in addition, the greatly enriched curriculum which it will find possible to
    offer its pupils, and the vexing question of the relation of the rural school to its
    pupils will be far toward solution.</p>
    <p>Let us next consider somewhat in detail the curriculum of the rural school.</p>

    <h3>THE CURRICULUM OF THE RURAL SCHOOL</h3>
    <p>If we grant the economic ability to support good schools, then the curriculum
    offered by any type of school, the scope of subject-matter given the pupils to
    master, is a measure of the educational ideals of those maintaining and using the
    schools. If the curriculum is broad, and representative of the various great fields
    of human culture; if it relates itself to the life and needs of its patrons; if it is
    adapted to the interests and activities of its pupils, it may be said that the people
    believe in education as a right of the individual and as a preparation for successful
    living. But if, on the other hand, the curriculum is meager and narrow, consisting
    only of the rudiments of knowledge, and not related to the life of the people or the
    interests of the pupils, then it may well be concluded that education is not highly
    prized, that it is not understood, or that it is looked upon as an incidental.</p>
    <h4><i>The scope of the rural school curriculum</i></h4>
    <p>Modern conditions require a broader and more<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> thorough education than that demanded
    by former times, and far more than the typical district rural school affords. The
    old-time school offered only the "three R's," and this was thought sufficient for an
    education. But these times have passed. Not only has society greatly increased in
    wealth during the last half-century, but it has also grown much in intelligence. Many
    more people are being educated now than formerly, and they are also being vastly
    better educated. For the concept of what constitutes an education has changed, and
    the curriculum has grown correspondingly broader and richer.</p>
    <p>It is therefore no longer possible to express the educational status of a
    community in the percentage of people who can merely read and write. Educational
    progress has become a national ideal. The elementary schools in towns and cities have
    been greatly strengthened both in curriculum and teaching. High schools have been
    organized and splendidly equipped, and their attendance has rapidly increased.</p>
    <p>But all this development has hardly touched the rural school. The curriculum
    offered is pitifully narrow even for an elementary school, and very few high schools
    are supported by rural communities. In fact, a large proportion of our rural<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> population are
    receiving an education but little in advance of that offered a hundred years ago in
    similar schools. This is not fair to the children born and reared on the farm; it is
    not fair to one of the greatest and most important industries of our country; and it
    cannot but result disastrously in the end.</p>
    <p>If the rural school is to meet its problem, it must extend the scope of its
    curriculum. It was formerly thought by many that education, except in its simplest
    elements, was only for those planning to enter the "learned professions." But this
    idea has given way before the onward sweep of the spirit of democracy, and we now
    conceive education as the right and duty of <i>all</i>. Nor by education do we mean
    the simple ability to read, write, and number.</p>
    <p>Our present-day civilization demands not only that the child shall be taught to
    read, but also that he shall be supplied with books and guided in his reading.
    Through reading as a tool he is to become familiar with the best in the world's
    literature and its history. He is not only to learn number, but is to be so educated
    that he may employ his number concepts in fruitful ways. He must not only be familiar
    with the mechanics of writing, but must have knowledge, interests,<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> experience that
    will give him something to write about. The "three R's" are necessary tools, but they
    are only tools, and must be utilized in putting the child into possession of the best
    and most fruitful culture of the race. And, practically, they must put him into
    command of such phases of culture as touch his own life and experience and make him
    more efficient.</p>
    <p>The rural school cannot extend the scope of its curriculum simply by inserting in
    the present curriculum new studies related to the life and work of the farm. The
    modification must be deeper and more thoroughgoing than this. <i>A full elementary
    course of eight years and a high school course of four years should be easily
    accessible to every rural child</i>. Less than this amount of education is inadequate
    to prepare for the life of the farm, and fails to put the individual into full
    possession of his powers. Nor, in most instances, should the high schooling be left
    to some adjacent town, which is to receive the rural pupils upon payment of tuition
    to the town district. Unless the town is small, and practically a part of the rural
    community, it cannot supply, either in the subject-matter of the curriculum or the
    spirit of the school, the type of education that the rural children should have. For
    in so far as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
    the town or city high school leads to any specific vocation, it certainly does not
    lead toward industrial occupations, and least of all toward agriculture. It rather
    prepares for the professions, or for business careers. Its tendency is very strongly
    to draw the boys and girls away from the farm instead of preparing them for it.</p>
    <p>While the rural child, therefore, must be provided with a better and broader
    education, he should usually not be sent to town to get it. If he is, the chances are
    that he will stay in town and be lost to the farm. Indeed, this is precisely what has
    been happening; the town or city high school has been turning the country boy away
    from the farm. For not only does what one studies supply his knowledge; it also
    determines his <i>attitude</i>.</p>
    <p>If the curriculum contains no subject-matter related to the immediate experience
    and occupation of the pupil, his education is certain to entice him away from his old
    interests and activities. The farm boy whose studies lack all point of contact with
    his life and work will soon either lose interest in the curriculum or turn his back
    upon the farm. If the boys and girls born on the farm are to be retained in this form
    of industry, the rural school must be broadened to give them<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> an education equal to that afforded by
    town or city for its youth. If the rural community cannot accomplish this end, it has
    no claim on the loyalty and service of its youth. Rural children have a right to a
    well-organized, well-equipped, and well-taught elementary school of eight years and a
    high school of four years, with a curriculum adapted especially to their interests
    and needs.</p>
    <p>It is not meant, of course, that the rural school, with its present organization
    and administration, can extend the scope of its curriculum to make it the equal of
    that offered in the grades of the town or city school. Radical changes, such as those
    discussed in the preceding chapter, will have to be made in the rural district system
    before this is possible. That these changes are being made and the full elementary
    and high school course offered in many consolidated rural schools, scattered from
    Florida to Idaho, is proof both of the feasibility of the plan and of an awakened
    public demand for better rural education.</p>
    <p>The broadened curriculum of the rural school must contain subject-matter
    especially related to the interests and activities of the farm; upon this all are
    agreed. But it must not stop with vocational subjects alone. For, while one's
    vocation is fundamental, it is not all of life. Education<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> should help directly in making a
    living; it must also help to live. Broad and permanent lines of interest must be set
    up and trained to include many forms of experience. The child must come to know
    something of the great social institutions of his day and of the history leading to
    their development. He must become familiar with the marvelous scientific discoveries
    and inventions underlying our modern civilization. He must be led to feel
    appreciation for the beautiful in art, literature, and music; and must have nurtured
    in his life a love for goodness and truth in every form. In short, through the
    curriculum the latent powers constituting the life capital of every normal child are
    to be stimulated and developed to the end that his life shall be more than mere
    physical existence&mdash;to the end that it shall be crowned with fullness of
    knowledge, richness of feeling, and the victory of worthy achievement. This is the
    right of every child in these prosperous and enlightened times,&mdash;the right of
    the country child as well as the city child. And society will not have done its duty
    in providing for the education of its youth until the children of the farm have full
    opportunities for such development.</p>
    <h4><i>The rural elementary school curriculum</i></h4>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
    <p>By the elementary school is meant the eight grades of work below the high school
    which the rural school is now meant to cover.</p>
    <p>Whatever is put into the curriculum of a nation's schools finally becomes a part
    of national character and achievement. What the children study in school comes to
    determine their attitudes and shape their aptitudes. The old Greek philosophers,
    becoming teachers of youth, turned the nation into a set of students and disputants
    over philosophical questions. Sparta taught her boys the arts of war, and became the
    chief military nation of her time. Germany introduces technological studies into her
    schools, and becomes the leading country in the world in the arts of manufacture. Let
    any people emphasize in their schools the studies that lead to commercial and
    professional interests, and neglect those that prepare for industrial vocations, and
    the industrial welfare of the nation is sure to suffer.</p>
    <p>The curriculum of the rural school must, therefore, contain the basic subjects
    that belong to all culture,&mdash;the studies that every normal, intelligent person
    should have just because he belongs to the twentieth-century civilization, and in
    addi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>tion must
    include the subjects that afford the knowledge and develop the attitude and technique
    belonging to the life of the farm. Let us now consider this curriculum somewhat more
    in detail.</p>
    <p><i>The mother tongue</i>. Mastery of his mother tongue is the birthright of every
    child. He should first of all be able to speak it correctly and with ease. He should
    next be able to read it with comprehension and enjoyment, and should become familiar
    with the best in its literature. He should be able to write it with facility, both as
    to its spelling and its composition. Finally, he should know something of the
    structure, or grammar, of the language.</p>
    <p>This requirement suggests the content of the curriculum as to English. The child
    must be given opportunity to use the language orally; he must be led to talk. But
    this implies that he must have something to say, and be interested in saying it.
    Formal "language lessons," divorced from all the child's interests and activities,
    will not meet the purpose. Facility in speech grows out of enthusiasm in speaking.
    Every recitation is a lesson in English, and should be used for this purpose; nor
    should the aim be correctness only, but ease and fluency as well.</p>
    <p>The child must also learn to read; not alone<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> to pronounce the printed words of a
    page, but to grasp the thought and feeling, and express them in oral reading. This
    presupposes a mastery of the mechanics of reading, the letters, words, and marks
    employed. The only way to learn to read is by reading. This is true whether we refer
    to learning the mechanics of reading, to learning the apprehension and expression of
    thought, or to learning the art of appreciating and enjoying good literature.</p>
    <p>Yet, trite and self-evident as this truism is, it is constantly violated in
    teaching reading in the rural school. For the course in reading usually consists of a
    series of five readers, expected to cover seven or eight years of study. These
    readers contain less than one hundred pages of reading matter to the year, or but
    little more than half a page a day for the time the child should be in school. The
    result is that the same reader is read over and over, to no purpose. With a rich
    literature available for each of the eight years of the elementary school,
    comparatively few of the rural schools have supplied either supplementary readers or
    other reading books for the use of the children.</p>
    <p>The result is that most rural school children learn to read but stumblingly, and
    seldom attain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
    sufficient skill and taste in reading so that it becomes a pleasure. Such a situation
    as this indicates the same lack of wisdom that would be shown in employing willing
    and skillful workmen to garner a rich harvest, and then sending them into the fields
    with wholly insufficient and inadequate tools. The rural school must not only teach
    the child the mechanics of reading, but lead him to read and love good books. This
    can be done only <i>by supplying the books and giving the child an opportunity to
    read them</i>.</p>
    <p>Comparatively few people like to write. The pathway of expression finds its way
    out more easily through the tongue than through the hand. Yet it is highly necessary
    that every one should in this day be able to write. Nor does this mean merely the
    ability to form letters into words and put them down with a pen so that they are
    legible. This is a fundamental requisite, but the mastery of penmanship, spelling,
    and punctuation is, however, only a beginning. One must be able to formulate his
    thoughts easily, to construct his sentences correctly, and to make his writing
    effective; he must learn the art of composition.</p>
    <p>Here again the principle already stated applies. The way to learn to write is by
    writing;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> not
    just by the dreary treadmill of practicing upon formal "compositions," but by having
    something to write that one cares to express. The written language lessons should,
    therefore, always grow out of the real interests and activities of the child in the
    home, the school, or on the farm, and should include the art of letter-writing,
    argumentation and exposition, as well as narration and description.</p>
    <p>The subject of formal grammar has little or no place in the grades of the
    elementary school. The grammatical relations of the language are complicated and
    beyond the power of the child at an early age. Nor does the study of such relations
    result in efficiency in the use of language, as is commonly supposed. Children are
    compelled in many schools to waste weary years in the study of logical relations they
    are too young to comprehend, when they should be reading, speaking, and writing their
    mother tongue under the stimulus and guidance of a teacher who is himself a worthy
    and enthusiastic model in the use of speech. Only the simpler grammatical forms and
    relations should be taught in the grades, and these should have immediate application
    to oral and written speech.</p>
    <p><i>Arithmetic</i>. Arithmetic has for more than two<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> hundred years formed an important part
    of the elementary school curriculum. It has been taught with the double object of
    affording mental discipline for the child, and of putting him into possession of an
    important tool of practical knowledge. It is safe to say that a large proportion of
    the patrons of the rural schools of the present look upon arithmetic as the most
    important subject taught in the school after the simple mechanics of reading. Ability
    to "cipher" has been thought of as constituting a large and important part of the
    educational equipment of the practical man.</p>
    <p>Without doubt, number is an essential part of the education of the child. Yet
    there is nothing in the mere art of numbering things as we meet them in daily
    experience that should make arithmetic require so large a proportion of time as it
    has been receiving. The child is usually started in number in the first grade, and
    continues it the full eight years of the elementary course, finally devoting three or
    more years of the high school course to its continued study. Thus, nearly one fourth
    of the entire school time of the pupil is demanded by the various phases of the
    number concept.</p>
    <p>The only ground upon which the expenditure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70"
    id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> of this large proportion of time upon number can be
    defended is that of <i>discipline</i>. And modern psychology and experimental
    pedagogy have shown the folly and waste of setting up empty discipline as an
    educational aim. Education time is too short, and the amount of rich and valuable
    material waiting to be mastered too great, to devote golden years to a relatively
    barren grind.</p>
    <p>It is probable that at least half the time at present devoted to arithmetic in the
    elementary school could be given to other subjects with no loss to the child's
    ability in number, and with great gain to his education as a whole. Not that the
    child knows number any too well now. He does not. In fact, few children finishing the
    elementary school possess any considerable degree of ability in arithmetic. They can
    work rather hard problems, if they have a textbook, and the answers by which to test
    their results. But give them a practical problem from the home, the farm, or the
    shop, and the chances are two to one that they cannot secure a correct result. This
    is not the fault of the child, but the fault of the kind of arithmetic he has been
    given, and the way it has been taught. We have taught him the solution of various
    difficult, analytical problems not in the least typical of the concrete<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> problems to be met
    daily outside of school; but we have not taught him to add, subtract, multiply, and
    divide with rapidity and accuracy. We have required him to solve problems containing
    fractions with large and irreducible denominators such as are never met in the
    business world, but he cannot readily and with certainty handle numbers expressed in
    halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, and eighths. He has been compelled to sacrifice
    practical business efficiency in number to an attempt to train his powers of logical
    analysis.</p>
    <p>The arithmetic of the district school should be greatly simplified and reduced in
    quantity. Its quality should be greatly improved both as to accuracy and speed in the
    fundamental operations and in the various concrete types of problems to be met in the
    home, on the farm, and in the shop. There need be no fear that the mental training
    will be less efficient with this type of arithmetic. For mental development comes
    only where there is mastery, and there is no mastery of the arithmetic as it is
    taught in the rural school to-day.</p>
    <p><i>History and civics</i>. Every American child should know the history and mode
    of government of his country. This is true first of all because this knowledge is
    necessary to intelligent partici<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72"
    id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>pation in the affairs of a republic; but it is also
    necessary to the right development of the individual that he shall realize something
    of the heroism and sacrifice required to produce the civilization which he enjoys.
    Every person needs to extend his thought and appreciation until it is large enough to
    include other peoples and times than his own. For only in this way can he come to
    feel kinship with the race at large, and thus save himself from provincialism and
    narrowness.</p>
    <p>This is equivalent to saying that the curriculum should afford ample opportunity
    for the study of history. Nor should the history given the child deal chiefly with
    the military and political activities of the nation. Many text books have been little
    more than an account of wars and politics. These are not the aspects of national life
    that most interest and concern the child, especially at the age when he is in the
    elementary school. He should at this time be told about the <i>people</i> of his
    country,&mdash;their home life, their industries, their schools and churches, their
    bravery, their hardships, adventures, and achievements. He must come to know
    something of the great men and women of his Nation and State, the writers, inventors,
    explorers, scientists,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg
    73]</a></span> artists, and musicians, as well as the soldiers and statesmen.</p>
    <p>Not only does this require that the child shall have suitable textbooks in
    history, but that he shall also have an adequate library of interesting histories,
    biographies, and historical fiction adapted to his age and interests. For it is not
    enough that the child shall learn the elementary facts of history while he is in the
    elementary school; more important still is it that he shall develop a real interest
    in history, and form the taste for reading historical matter.</p>
    <p>The course in history must, therefore, contain such matter as the child will love
    to read; for only then will it leave the desire to read. It must so put a premium
    upon patriotism, loyalty to country, and high-grade citizenship that the child shall
    feel the impulse to emulate the noble men and women who have contributed to our
    happiness and welfare. The study of history, even in the elementary school, should
    eventuate in loyal, efficient citizenship.</p>
    <p>The civics taught in the elementary school should be very practical and concrete.
    The age has not yet come for a study of the federal or state constitution. It is
    rather the <i>functional</i> aspect of government that should be presented at<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> this time&mdash;the
    points of contact of school district, township, county, state and federal government
    with the individual. How the school is supported and controlled; how the bridges are
    built and roads repaired; the work of township and county affairs; the powers and
    duties of boards of health; the right of franchise and the use of the ballot; the
    work of the postal system; the making and enforcing of laws,&mdash;these and similar
    topics suggest what the child should come to know from the study of civics. The great
    problem here is to influence conduct in the direction of upright citizenship, and to
    give such a knowledge of the machinery, especially of local government, as will lead
    to efficient participation in its activities.</p>
    <p><i>Geography and nature study</i>. The rural school has a great advantage over the
    city school in the teaching of geography and nature study. For the country child is
    closer to the earth and its products than the city child. The broad expanse of nature
    is always before him; life in its multiple forms constantly appeals to his eye and
    ear. He watches the seeds planted, and sees the crops cultivated and harvested. He
    has a very concrete sense of the earth as the home of man, and possesses a basis of
    practical knowledge for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg
    75]</a></span> understanding the resources and products of his own and other
    countries.</p>
    <p>Geography should, therefore, be one of the most vital and useful branches in the
    rural school. It is to begin wherever the life of the child touches nature in his
    immediate environment, and proceed from this on out to other parts of his home land,
    and finally to all lands.</p>
    <p>But the geography taught must not be of the old catechism type, which resulted in
    children committing to memory the definitions of geographical terms instead of
    studying the real objects ready at hand. It must not concern itself with the pupil's
    learning the names and locations of dozens of places and geographical forms of no
    particular importance, instead of coming into immediate touch with natural
    environment and with the earth in the larger sense as it bears upon his own life. The
    author has expressed this idea in another place as follows:&mdash;</p>
    <p>"The content of geography is, therefore, synonymous with the content of the
    experience of the child as related to his own interests and activities, in so far as
    they grow out of the earth as his home. Towns and cities begin with the ones nearest
    at hand. The concept of rivers has its rise in the one that flows past the child's
    home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> Valleys,
    mountains, capes, and bays are but modifications of those that lie within the circle
    of personal experience. Generalizations must come to be made, but they must rest upon
    concrete and particular instances if they are to constitute a reality to the
    learner.</p>
    <p>"What kind of people live in a country, what they work at, what they eat, and how
    they live in their homes and their schools, what weather they have, and what they
    wear, how they travel and speak and read,&mdash;these are more vital questions to the
    child than the names and locations of unimportant streams, towns, capes, and bays.
    For they are the things that touch his own experience, and hence appeal to his
    interest. Only as geography is given this social background, and concerns itself with
    the earth as related to social activities, can it fulfill its function in the
    elementary school."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
    <p><i>Hygiene and health</i>. Since health is at the basis of all success and
    happiness, nothing can be more important in the education of the child than the
    subject of practical hygiene. It has been the custom in our schools until recently,
    however, to give the child a difficult and uninteresting text book dealing with
    physiology and anatomy, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg
    77]</a></span> containing almost nothing on hygiene and the laws of health.</p>
    <p>Not only should the course in physiology emphasize the laws of hygiene, but this
    hygiene should in part have particular bearing on right living under the conditions
    imposed by the farm. Food, its variety, adaptability, and preparation; clothing for
    the different seasons; work, recreation, and play; care of the eyes and teeth;
    bathing; the ventilation of the home, and especially of sleeping-rooms; the effects
    of tobacco and cigarettes in checking growth and reducing efficiency; the more simple
    and obvious facts bearing on the relation of bacteria to the growth, preparation, and
    spoiling of foods; the means to be taken to prevent bacterial contagion of
    diseases,&mdash;these are some of the practical matters that every child should know
    as a result of his study of physiology and hygiene.</p>
    <p>But we must go one step further still. It is not enough to teach these things as
    matters of abstract theory or truth. Plenty of people know better hygiene than they
    are practicing. The subject must be presented so concretely and effectively and be
    supported by such incentives that it will actually lead to better habits of
    living&mdash;that it will <i>result in higher physical efficiency</i>.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
    <p><i>Agriculture</i>. Agriculture is of course preeminently a subject for the rural
    school. Not only is it of immediate and direct practical importance, but it is coming
    to be looked upon as so useful a cultural study that it is being introduced into many
    city schools.</p>
    <p>It has been objected that agriculture as a science cannot be taught in the
    elementary school because of the lack of age and development of the pupils. This is
    true, but neither can any other subject be taught to children of this age as a
    complete science. It is possible, however, to give children in the rural elementary
    school much useful information concerning agriculture. Perhaps better still, it is
    possible to develop a scientific attitude and interest that will lead to further
    study of the subject in the high school or agricultural college, and that will in the
    mean-time serve to attach the boys and girls to the farm.</p>
    <p>The rural school pupils can be made familiar with the best modes of planting and
    cultivating the various crops, and with the diseases and insect enemies which
    threaten them; the selection of seed; the rotation of crops, and many other practical
    things applying directly to their home life. School gardens of vegetables and
    flowers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
    constitute another center of interest and information, and serve to unite the school
    and the home.</p>
    <p>Similarly the animal life of the farm can be studied, and a knowledge gained of
    the best varieties of farm stock, their breeding and care. Insects and bird life can
    be observed, and their part in the growth or destruction of crops understood. All
    this is not only practicable, but necessary as part of the rural school curriculum.
    Anything less than this amount of practical agriculture leaves the rural school in
    some degree short of fulfilling its function.</p>
    <p><i>Domestic science and manual training</i>. In general what is true of
    agriculture is true of domestic science and manual training. They can be presented in
    the elementary school only in the most concrete and applied form. But they can be
    successfully presented in this form, and must be if the rural school child is to have
    an equal opportunity with the town and city child. The girls can be taught the art of
    sewing, cooking, and serving, if only the necessary equipment and instruction are
    available. They are ready to learn, the subject-matter is adapted to their age and
    understanding, and nothing could be more vital to their interests and welfare.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
    <p>Likewise the boys can be taught the use of tools, the value and finishing of
    different kinds of woods, and can develop no little skill with their hands, while
    they are at the same time receiving mental development and the cultivation of
    practical interests from this line of work. It is not in the least a question of the
    readiness of the boys to take up and profit by this subject, but is only a matter of
    equipment and teaching.</p>
    <p><i>Music and art</i>. Nor should the finer aspects of culture be left out of the
    education of the country child. He will learn music as readily as the city child, and
    love it not less. Indeed, he needs it even more as a part of his schooling, since the
    opportunities to hear and enjoy music are always at hand in the city, and nearly
    always lacking in the country. The child should be taught to sing and at least to
    understand and appreciate music of worthy type.</p>
    <p>The same principle will apply to art. The great masterpieces of painting and
    sculpture have as much of beauty and inspiration in them as the great masterpieces of
    literature. Yet most rural children complete their schooling hardly having seen in
    the schoolroom a worthy copy of a great picture, and much less have they been taught
    the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
    significance of great works of art or been led to appreciate and love them.</p>
    <p><i>Physical training</i>. It has been argued by many that the rural child has
    enough exercise and hence does not need physical training. But this position entirely
    misconceives the purpose of physical training. One may have plenty of exercise, even
    too much exercise, without securing a well-balanced physical development. Indeed,
    certain forms of farm work done by children are often so severe a tax on their
    strength that a corrective exercise is necessary in order to save stooped forms,
    curved spines, and hollow chests. Furthermore, the farm child, lacking the
    opportunities of the city child for gaining social ease and control, needs the
    development that comes from physical training to give poise, ease of bearing, and
    grace of movement.</p>
    <p>Nor must the athletic phase of physical training be overlooked. While it is
    undoubtedly true that athletics have come to occupy too large a part of the time and
    absorb too great a proportion of the interest in many schools, yet this is no reason
    for omitting avocational training wholly from the rural school. Children require the
    training and development that come from games and play quite as much as they need
    that coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
    from work. The school owes a duty to the avocational side of life as well as to the
    vocational.</p>
    <p>The curriculum here proposed is so much broader and richer than that now offered
    in the rural district school that it will appear to many to be visionary and
    impossible. That it is impossible for the old type of rural school will be readily
    admitted. But it is entirely practicable and possible in the reorganized consolidated
    school, and is being successfully presented, in its general aspects, at least, in
    many of these schools. It is only such an education as every rural child is entitled
    to, and is no more than the urban child is already receiving in the better class of
    town and city elementary schools. If the rural school cannot give the farm child an
    elementary education approximating the one out-lined, it has no claim on his loyalty
    or time; and he should in justice to himself be taken where he can receive a worthy
    education, even if he is thereby lost to the farm.</p>
    <p>But the rural boy and girl need not only a good elementary education, but a high
    school education as well. Let us next consider the rural high school curriculum.</p>
    <h4><i>The rural high school curriculum</i></h4>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
    <p>This section is presented in the full knowledge that comparatively few localities
    have as yet established the rural high school. It now forms, however, an integral
    part of the consolidated rural school in not a few places, and is abundantly
    justifying the expenditure made upon it. In other localities the tendency is growing
    to send the rural child to the town high school, or even for the family to move to
    town to secure high schooling for the children. In still other cases, and we are
    obliged to admit that these yet constitute the rule rather than the exception, the
    farm boy or girl has no opportunity for a high school education.</p>
    <p>If we succeed in working out the so-called rural problem of our country, in
    maintaining a high standard of agricultural population and rural life, the rural high
    school must be an important factor in our problem. For the children of our farms need
    and must have an education reaching beyond that of the elementary school. And this
    schooling must prepare them to find the most satisfactory and successful type of life
    on the farm, instead of drawing them away from the farm.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
    <p>It goes without saying that the rural high school should be an agricultural high
    school. This does not mean that it shall devote itself exclusively to teaching
    agriculture; but rather that, while it offers a broad range of culture and
    information, it shall emphasize those phases of subject-matter that will best fit
    into the interests and activities of farm life, instead of those phases that tend to
    lead toward the city or the market-place. Its four years of work must be fully equal
    to that of the best town or city high schools, but must in some degree be different
    work. It must result in <i>efficiency</i>, and efficiency here must relate itself to
    agricultural life and pursuits.</p>
    <p>A detailed discussion of the rural high school curriculum will not be required.
    The principles already suggested as applying to the elementary school will govern
    here as well. The studies must cultivate breadth of view and a wide range of
    interests, and must at the same time bear upon the immediate life and experience of
    the pupils. The lines of study begun in the elementary school will be continued, with
    the purpose of securing deeper insight, more detailed knowledge, and greater
    independence of judgment and action.</p>
    <p>English should form an important part of the<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> curriculum, with the double aim of
    securing facility in the use of the mother tongue and of developing a love for its
    literature. The rural high school graduate should be able to write English correctly
    as to spelling, punctuation, and grammar; he should be able to express himself
    effectively, either in writing, conversation, or the more formal speech of the
    rostrum. Above all, he should be an enthusiastic and discriminating reader, with a
    catholicity of taste and interest that will lead him beyond the agricultural journal
    and newspaper, important as these are, to the works of fiction, material and social
    science, travel and biography, current magazines and journals, and whatever else
    belongs to the intellectual life of an intelligent, educated man of affairs.</p>
    <p>This is asking more than is being accomplished at present by the course in English
    in the town high school, but not more than is easily within the range of possibility.
    The average high school graduate of to-day cannot always spell and punctuate
    correctly, and commonly cannot write well even an ordinary business letter; nor, it
    must be feared, has his study of literature had a very great influence in developing
    him into a good reader of worthy books.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86"
    id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
    <p>But all this can be remedied by vitalizing the teaching of the mother tongue; by
    lessening the proportion of time and emphasis placed upon critical analysis and
    technical literary criticism, and increasing that given to the drill and practice
    that alone can make sure of the fundamentals of spelling, punctuation, and the common
    forms of composition emphasized by all; and by the sympathetic, enthusiastic teaching
    of good literature adapted to the age and interests of the pupils from the standpoint
    of synthetic appreciation and enjoyment, rather than from the standpoint of
    mechanical analysis.</p>
    <p>The rural high school course in social science should be broad and thorough. The
    course in history should not give an undue proportion of time to ancient and medieval
    history, nor to war and politics. Emphasis should be placed on the social,
    industrial, and economic phases of human development in modern times and in our own
    country.</p>
    <p>Political economy should form an important branch. Especially should it deal with
    the problems of production, distribution, and consumption as they relate to
    agriculture. Matters of finance, taxation, and investment, while resting on general
    principles, should be applied to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87"
    id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> problems of the farm. Nor should the economic basis
    of support and expenditure in the home be overlooked.</p>
    <p>The course in civics should not only present the general theory of government, but
    should apply concretely to the civic relations and duties of a rural population.
    Especially should it appeal to the civic conscience and sense of responsibility which
    we need among our rural people to make the country an antidote to the political
    corruption of the city.</p>
    <p>Material science should constitute an important section of the rural high school
    curriculum. Not only does its study afford one of the best means of mental
    development, but the subject-matter of science has a very direct bearing on the life
    and industries of the farm. To achieve the best results, however, the science taught
    must be presented from the concrete and applied point of view rather than from the
    abstract and general. This does not mean that a hodge-podge of unrelated facts shall
    be taught in the place of science; indeed, such a method would defeat the whole
    purpose of the course. It means, however, that the general laws and principles of
    science shall be carried out to their practical bearing on the problems of the home
    and the farm, and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg
    88]</a></span> be left just as general laws or abstract principles unapplied.</p>
    <p>The botany and zo&ouml;logy of the rural high school will, of course, have a
    strong agricultural trend. It will sacrifice the old logical classifications and
    study of generic types of animals and plants for the more interesting and useful
    study of the fauna and flora of the locality. The various farm crops, their weed
    enemies, the helpful and harmful insects and birds, the animal life of the barnyard,
    horticulture and floriculture, and the elements of bacteriology, will constitute
    important elements in the course.</p>
    <p>The course in physics will develop the general principles of the subject, and will
    then apply these principles to the machinery of the farm, to the heating, lighting,
    and ventilation of houses, to the drainage of soil, the plumbing of buildings, and a
    hundred other practical problems bearing on the life of the farm. Chemistry will be
    taught as related to the home, foods, soils, and crops. A concrete geology will lead
    to a better understanding of soils, building materials, and drainage. Physiology and
    hygiene will seek as their aim longer life and higher personal efficiency.</p>
    <p>The course in agriculture, whether presented separately or in conjunction with
    botany and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
    zo&ouml;logy, must be comprehensive and thorough. Not only should it give a complete
    and practical knowledge of the selection of seed; the planting, cultivating, and
    harvesting of crops; the improvement and conservation of the soil; the breeding and
    care of stock, etc., but it must serve to create and develop a scientific attitude
    toward farming. The farmer should come to look upon his work as offering the largest
    opportunities for the employment of technical knowledge, judgment, and skill. That
    such an attitude will yield large returns in success is attested by many farmers
    to-day who are applying scientific methods to their work.</p>
    <p>Manual training and domestic science should receive especial emphasis in the rural
    high school. Both subjects have undoubted educational value in themselves, and their
    practical value and importance to those looking forward to farm life can hardly be
    over-estimated. And in these as in other subjects, the course offered will need to be
    modified from that of the city school in order to meet the requirements of the
    particular problems to which the knowledge and training secured are to be
    applied.</p>
    <p>Mathematics should form a part of the rural high school curriculum, but the
    traditional courses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
    90]</a></span> in algebra and geometry do not meet the need. The ideal course would
    probably be a skillful combination of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry occupying
    the time of one or two years, and applied directly to the problems of mechanics,
    measurements, surveying, engineering, and building on the farm. Such an idea is not
    new, and textbooks are now under way providing material for such a course.</p>
    <p>In addition, there should be a thorough course in practical business arithmetic.
    By this is not meant the abstract, analytical matter so often taught as high school
    arithmetic, but concrete and applied commercial and industrial arithmetic, with
    particular reference to farm problems. In connection with this subject should be
    given a course in household accounts, and book-keeping, including commercial forms
    and commercial law.</p>
    <p>It is doubtful whether foreign language has any place in the rural high school. If
    offered at all, it should be only in high schools strong enough to offer parallel
    courses for election, and should never displace the subjects lying closer to the
    interests and needs of the students.</p>
    <p>The study of music and art begun in the elementary school should be continued in
    the high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
    school, and a love for the beautiful cultivated not only by the matter taught, but
    also by the &aelig;sthetic qualities of the school buildings and grounds and their
    decoration. On the practical sides these subjects will reach out to the beautifying
    of the farm homes and the life they shelter.</p>
    <p>When a well-taught curriculum of some such scope of elementary and high school
    work as that suggested is as freely available to the farm child as his school is
    available to the city child, will the country boys and girls have a fair chance for
    education. And when this comes about, the greatest single obstacle to keeping our
    young people on the farm will have been removed.</p>

    <h3>THE TEACHING OF THE RURAL SCHOOL</h3>
    <h4><i>The importance of teaching</i></h4>
    <p>Teaching is the fundamental purpose for which the school is run. Taxes are levied
    and collected, buildings erected and equipped, and curriculum organized solely that
    teaching may go on. Children are clothed and fed and sent to school instead of being
    put at work in order that they may be taught. The school is classified into grades,
    programs are arranged, and regulations are enforced only to make teaching possible.
    Normal schools are established, teachers are trained, and certificates required in
    order that teaching may be more efficient.</p>
    <p>The teacher confronts a great task. On the one hand are the children, ignorant,
    immature, and undeveloped. In them lie ready to be called forth all the powers and
    capacities that will characterize their fully ripened manhood and womanhood. Given
    the right stimulus and direction, these powers will grow into splendid strength and
    ca<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>pacity;
    lacking this stimulus and guidance, the powers are left crippled and incomplete.</p>
    <p>On the other hand is the subject-matter of education, the heritage of culture
    which has been accumulating through the ages. In the slow process of human
    experience, running through countless generations, men have made their discoveries in
    the fields of mathematics and science; they have lived great events and achievements
    which have become history; they have developed the social institutions which we call
    the State, the church, the home, and the school; they have organized great industries
    and carried on complex vocations; they have crystallized their ideals, their hopes,
    and their aspirations in literature; and have with brush and chisel expressed in art
    their concepts of truth and beauty. The best of all this human experience we have
    collected in what we call a curriculum, and placed it before the child for him to
    master, as the generations before him have mastered it in their common lives. For
    only in this way can the child come into full possession of his powers, and set them
    at work in a fruitful way in accomplishing his own life-purpose.</p>
    <p>It is the function of the teacher, therefore, to stand as an intermediary, as an
    interpreter, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg
    94]</a></span>tween the child and this great mass of subject-matter that lies ready
    for him to learn. The race has lived its thousands or millions of years; the
    individual lives but a few score. What former generations took centuries to work out
    the child can spend only a few months or a few years upon. Hence he must waste no
    time and opportunity; he must make no false step in his learning, for he cannot in
    his short life retrieve his mistakes. It is the work of the teacher, through
    instruction and guidance, that is, through teaching, to save the child time in his
    learning and development, and to make sure that he does not lose his opportunity. And
    this is a great responsibility.</p>
    <p>Thus the teacher confronts a problem that has two great factors, the <i>child</i>
    and the <i>subject-matter</i>. He must have a knowledge of both these factors if his
    work is to be effective; for he cannot teach matter that he does not know, and
    neither can he teach a person whose nature he does not understand. But in addition to
    a knowledge of these factors, the teacher must also master a technique of
    instruction, he must train himself in the art of teaching.</p>
    <p><i>The teacher must know the child</i>. It has been a rather common impression
    that if one knows a certain field of subject-matter, he will surely be<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> able to teach it to
    others. But nothing could be further from the truth than such an assumption. Indeed,
    it is proverbial that the great specialists are the most wretched teachers of their
    subjects. The nature of the child's mental powers, the order of their unfoldment, the
    evolution of his interests, the incentives that appeal to him, the danger points in
    both his intellectual and his moral development,&mdash;these and many other things
    about child nature the intelligent teacher must clearly understand.</p>
    <p>And the teacher of the younger children needs this knowledge even more than the
    teacher of older ones. For the earlier years of the child's schooling are the most
    important years. It is at this time that he lays the foundation for all later
    learning, that he forms his habits of study and his attitude toward education, and
    that his life is given the bent for all its later development. Nothing can be more
    irrational, therefore, than to put the most untrained and inexperienced teachers in
    charge of the younger children. The fallacious notion that "anyone can teach little
    children" has borne tragic fruit in the stagnation and mediocrity of many lives whose
    powers were capable of great achievements.</p>
    <p><i>The teacher must know the subject-matter</i>. The<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> blind cannot successfully lead the
    blind. One whose grasp of a subject extends only to the simplest rudiments cannot
    teach these rudiments. He who has never himself explored a field can hardly guide
    others through that field; at least, progress through the field will be at the cost
    of great waste of time and failure to grasp the significance or beauty of what the
    field contains.</p>
    <p>Expressed more concretely, it is impossible to transplant arithmetic, or
    geography, or history, or anything else that one would teach, immediately from the
    textbook into the mind of the child. The subject must first come to be very fully and
    completely a true possession of the teacher. The successful teacher must also know
    vastly more of a subject than he is required to teach. For only then has he freedom;
    only then has he outlook and perspective; only then can he teach the <i>subject</i>,
    and not some particular textbook; only then can he inspire others to effort and
    achievement through his own mastery and interest. Enthusiasm is <i>caught</i> and not
    taught.</p>
    <p><i>The teacher must know the technique of instruction</i>. For teaching is an art,
    based upon scientific principles and requiring practice to secure skill. One of the
    greatest tasks of the teacher is to <i>psychologize</i> the subject-matter for his
    pupils,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg
    97]</a></span>&mdash;that is, so to select, organize, and present it that the child's
    mind naturally and easily grasps and appropriates it. Teaching, when it has become an
    art, which is to say, when the teacher has become an artist, is one of the most
    highly skilled vocations. It is as much more difficult than medicine as the human
    mind is more baffling than the human body; it is as much more difficult than
    preaching as the child is harder to comprehend and guide than the adult; it is as
    much more difficult than the law as life is more complex than logic.</p>
    <p>Yet, while we require the highest type of preparation for medicine, the ministry,
    or the law, we require but little for teaching. We pay enormous salaries to trained
    experts to apply the principles of scientific management to our industries or our
    business, but we have been satisfied with inexpert service for the teaching of our
    children. We are making fortunes out of the stoppage of waste in our factories, but
    allowing enormous waste to continue in our schools. <i>If we were to put into
    practice in teaching the thoroughly demonstrated and accepted scientific principles
    of education as we know them, we could beyond doubt double the educational results
    attained by our children</i>.</p>
    <h4><i>Teaching in the rural school</i></h4>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
    <p>The criticisms just made on our standards of teaching will apply in some degree to
    all our schools from the kindergarten to the university; but they apply more strongly
    to the rural schools than to any other class. For the rural schools are the
    training-ground for young, inexperienced, and relatively unprepared teachers. Except
    for the comparatively small proportion of the town or city teachers who are normal
    school or college trained, nearly all have served an apprenticeship in the rural
    schools. Thus the rural school, besides its other handicaps, is called upon to train
    teachers for the more favored urban schools.</p>
    <p>Careful statistical studies<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> have shown that many rural teachers,
    both men and women, have had no training beyond that of the elementary school. And
    not infrequently this training has taken place in the rural school of the type in
    which they themselves take up teaching. The average schooling of the men teaching in
    the rural schools of the entire country is less than two years above the elementary
    school, and of women, slightly more than two years. This is to say that our rural
    schools are taught by those who have had only about half of a high school course.</p>
    <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
    <p>It is evident, therefore, that the rural teacher cannot meet the requirement urged
    above in the way of preparation. He does not know his subject-matter. Not only has he
    not gone far enough in his education to have a substantial foundation, breadth of
    view, and mental perspective, but he frequently lacks in the simplest rudiments of
    the immediate subject-matter which he is supposed to teach. The examination papers
    written by applicants for certificates to begin rural school teaching often betray a
    woful ignorance of the most fundamental knowledge. Inability to spell, punctuate, or
    effectively use the English language is common. The most elementary scientific truths
    are frequently unknown. A connected view of our nation's history and knowledge of
    current events are not always possessed. The great world of literature is too often a
    closed book. And not seldom the simple relations of arithmetical number are beyond
    the grasp of the applicant. In short, our rural schools, as they average, require no
    adequate preparation of the teacher, and do not represent as much education in their
    teaching force as that needed by the intelligent farmer, merchant, or tradesman.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
    <p>The rural teacher does not know the child. But little more than children
    themselves, and with little chance for observation or for experience in life, it
    would be strange if they did. They have had no opportunity for professional study,
    and psychology and the science of education are unknown to them. The attempts made to
    remedy this fatal weakness by the desultory reading of a volume or two in a voluntary
    reading-circle course do not serve the purpose. The teacher needs a thorough course
    of instruction in general and applied psychology, under the tutelage of an
    enthusiastic expert who not only knows his subject, but also understands the problems
    of the teacher.</p>
    <p>The rural teacher does not know the technique of the schoolroom. The organizing of
    a school, the proper classification of pupils, the assignment of studies, the
    arrangement of a program of studies and recitation, the applications of suitable
    regulations and rules for the running of the school, are all matters requiring expert
    knowledge and skill. Yet the rural teacher has to undertake them without instruction
    in their principles and without supervisory guidance or help. No wonder that the
    rural school is poorly organized and managed. It presents problems of administration
    more puz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg
    101]</a></span>zling than the town school, and yet here is where we put out our
    novices, boys and girls not yet out of their "teens"&mdash;young people who
    themselves have no concept of the problems of the school, no knowledge of its complex
    machinery, and no experience to serve as a guide in confronting their work. No
    industrial enterprise could exist under such irrational conditions; and neither could
    the schools, except that mental waste and bankruptcy are harder to measure than
    economic.</p>
    <p>Nor does the rural teacher know the technique of instruction any better than that
    of organization and management. The skillful conducting of a recitation is at least
    as severe a test upon mental resourcefulness and skill as making a speech, preaching
    a sermon, or conducting a lawsuit. For not only must the subject-matter be organized
    for immature minds unused to the formal processes of learning, but the effects of
    instruction upon the child's mind must constantly be watched by the teacher and
    interpreted with reference to further instruction. This skill cannot be attained
    empirically, by the cut-and-dried method, except at a frightful cost to the children.
    It is as if we were to turn a set of intelligent but untrained men loose in the
    community with their scalpels and their medicine cases to learn to be<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> surgeons and
    doctors by experimenting upon their fellows.</p>
    <p>As would naturally be expected, therefore, the teaching in the average rural
    school is a dreary round of inefficiency. Handicapped to begin with by classes too
    small to be interesting, the rural teacher is mechanically hearing the recitations of
    some twenty-five to thirty of these classes per day. Lacking at the beginning the
    breadth of education that would make teaching easy, he finds it impossible to prepare
    for so many different exercises daily. The result is that the recitations are dull,
    spiritless, uninteresting. The lessons are poorly prepared by the pupils, poorly
    recited, and hence very imperfectly mastered. The more advanced work cannot stand on
    such a foundation of sand, and so, discouraged, the child soon drops out of
    school.</p>
    <p>When it is also remembered that the tenure of service of the teacher is very short
    in the rural schools, the problem becomes all the more grave. The average term of
    service in the rural schools is probably not above two years, and in many States
    considerably below this amount. This requires that half of the rural teachers each
    year shall be beginners. It will be impossible, of course, as long as teaching is
    done so largely by girls, who nat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103"
    id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>urally will, and should, soon quit teaching for
    marriage, to secure a long period of service in the vocation. Yet the rural school
    is, as we have seen, also constantly losing its trained teachers to the town and
    city, and hence breaking in more than its share of novices.</p>
    <p>Added to the disadvantage inevitably coming from the brief period of service in
    teaching is a similar one growing out of a faulty method of administration. In a
    large majority of our rural schools the contract is made for but one term of not more
    than three months. This leaves the teacher free to accept another school at the end
    of the term, and not infrequently a school will have two or even three different
    teachers within the same year. There is a great source of waste at this point, owing
    to a change of methods, repetition of work, and the necessity of starting a new
    system of school machinery. Industrial concerns would hardly find it profitable to
    change superintendents and foremen several times a year. We do this in our schools
    only because we have not yet learned that it pays to apply rational business methods
    to education.</p>
    <p>Nothing that has been said in criticism of rural teaching ought to be construed as
    a reflection on the rural teachers personally. The fact that<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> they can succeed as well as they do
    under conditions that are so adverse is the best warrant for their intelligence and
    devotion. It is not their fault that they begin teaching with inadequate knowledge of
    subject-matter, with ignorance of the nature of childhood, and without skill in the
    technique of the schoolroom. The system, and not the individual, is at fault. The
    public demands a pitifully low standard of efficiency in rural teaching, and the
    excellence of the product offered is not likely greatly to surpass what society asks
    and is ready to pay for.</p>
    <p>Once again we must turn to the consolidated school as the solution of our
    difficulty. The isolated district school will not be able to demand and secure a
    worthy grade of preparation for teaching. The educational standards will not rise
    high enough under this system to create a public demand for skilled teachers. Nor can
    such salaries be paid as will encourage thorough and extensive study and preparation
    for teaching. And, finally, the professional incentives are not sufficiently strong
    in such schools to create a true craft spirit toward teaching.</p>
    <p>While it is impossible to measure the improved results in teaching coming from the
    consolidated school in the same objective way that we can<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> measure increased attendance, yet
    there is no doubt that one of the strongest arguments for the consolidated school is
    its more skillful and inspiring teaching. The increased salaries, the possibility of
    professional association with other teachers, the improved equipment, the better
    supervision, and above all, the spirit of progress and enthusiasm in the school
    itself, all serve to transform teaching from a treadmill routine into a joyful
    opportunity for inspiration and service.</p>
    <h4><i>The training of rural teachers</i></h4>
    <p>The training of the rural teacher has never been given the same consideration as
    that of town or city teachers. It is true that normal schools are available to all
    alike, and that in a few States the rural schools secure a considerable number of
    teachers who have had some normal training. But this is the exception rather than the
    rule. In the Middle Western States, for example, where there is a rich agricultural
    population, whole counties can be found in which no rural teacher has ever had any
    special training for his work. Professional requirements have been on a par with the
    meager salaries paid, and other incentives have not been strong enough to insure
    adequate preparation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg
    106]</a></span></p>
    <p>State normal schools have, therefore, been of comparatively little assistance in
    fitting teachers for the rural school. First of all the rural school teacher
    ordinarily does not go to the normal school, for it is not demanded of him. Again, if
    perchance a prospective rural teacher should attend a normal school, a town or city
    grade position is usually waiting for him when he graduates. For, in spite of the
    growth of our normal schools, they are as yet far from being able to supply all the
    teachers required for the urban grade positions, to say nothing about the rural
    schools. The colleges and universities are, of course, still further removed from the
    rural school, since the high schools stand ready to employ those of their graduates
    who enter upon teaching.</p>
    <p>In some States, as for example, Wisconsin, county normal schools have been
    established with the special aim of preparing teachers for the rural schools. While
    this movement has helped, it does not promise to secure wide acceptance as a method
    of dealing with the problem. Greater possibilities undoubtedly exist in the
    comparatively recent movement toward combining normal training with the regular high
    school course. Provision for such courses now exists in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
    Texas, Minnesota,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg
    107]</a></span> Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and a number of other States.</p>
    <p>Combining normal training with high school education has first of all the
    advantage of bringing such training <i>to</i> prospective teachers, instead of
    requiring the teachers to leave home and incur additional expense in seeking their
    training. From the standpoint of the public it has the merit of economy, in that it
    utilizes buildings, equipment, and organization already in existence instead of
    requiring new.</p>
    <p>But whatever may be the method employed, the rural teachers should receive better
    preparation for their work than they now have. This means, <i>first</i>, that the
    State must make adequate provision for the teacher to receive his training at a
    minimum of expense and trouble; and <i>second</i>, that the standard of requirement
    must be such that the teacher will be obliged to secure adequate preparation before
    being admitted to the school. Even with the present status of our rural schools it is
    not too much to require that every teacher shall have had <i>at least a four-year
    high school education</i>, and that <i>a reasonable amount of normal training</i> be
    had either in conjunction with the high school course, or subsequent to its
    completion. Indiana, for example, has found this<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> requirement entirely feasible, and
    a great influence in bettering the tone of the rural school.</p>
    <p>Wherever the rural teacher secures his training, however, one condition must
    obtain: this preparation must familiarize him with the spirit and needs of the
    agricultural community, and imbue him with enthusiasm for service in this field. It
    is not infrequently the case that town high school graduates, themselves never having
    lived in the country, possess neither the sympathy nor the understanding necessary to
    enable them to offer a high grade of service in the rural school. Not a few of them
    feel above the work of such a position, and look with contempt or pity upon the life
    of the farm. The successful rural teacher must be able to identify himself very
    completely with the interests and activities of the community; nor can this be done
    in any half-hearted, sentimental, or professional manner. It must be a spontaneous
    and natural response arising from a true interest in the people, a knowledge of their
    lives, and a sincere desire for their welfare. Any preparation that does not result
    in this spirit, and train in the ability to realize it in action, does not fit for
    the rural school.</p>
    <h4><i>Salaries of rural teachers</i></h4>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
    <p>The salaries paid teachers in general in different types of schools are one
    measure, though not a perfect one, of their efficiency. Salary is not a perfect
    measure of efficiency, (1) because economic ability to pay is a modifying influence.
    When the early New England teacher was receiving ten or twelve dollars a month and
    "boarding round," he was probably getting all that the community could afford to pay
    him, although he was often a college student, and not infrequently a well-trained
    graduate. The salaries paid in the various occupations are not (2) based upon any
    definite standards of the value of service. For example, the <i>chef</i> in a hotel
    may receive more than the superintendent of schools, and the football coach more than
    the college president; yet we would hardly want to conclude that the services of the
    cook and the athlete are worth more to society than the services of educators. And
    within the vocation of teaching itself there is (3) no fixed standard for judging
    teaching efficiency. Nevertheless, in general, teaching efficiency is in considerable
    degree measured by differences in salaries paid in different localities and in the
    various levels of school work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110"
    id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
    <p>Based on the standard of salary as a measure, the teaching efficiency of rural
    teachers is, as we should expect from starting nearly all of our beginners here,
    considerably below that in towns or cities. A study by Coffman<a name="FNanchor_6_6"
    id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of more than
    five thousand widely distributed teachers as to age, sex, salary, etc., shows that
    the average man in the rural school receives an annual salary of $390; in town
    schools, of $613; and in city schools, of $919. The average woman in the rural school
    receives an annual salary of $366; in town schools, of $492; and in city schools, of
    $591. Men in towns, therefore, receive one and one half times as much as men in the
    country, and in cities, two and one half times as much as in the country. Women in
    towns receive a little more than one and one third times as much as women in the
    country, and in the cities almost one and two thirds times as much as women in the
    country.</p>
    <p>The actual amount of salary paid rural teachers is perhaps more instructive than
    the comparative amounts. The income of the rural teacher is barely a living wage, and
    not even that if the teacher has no parental home, or a gainful occupation during
    vacation times. Out of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg
    111]</a></span> amount of less than four hundred dollars a year the teacher is
    expected to pay for a certificate, a few school journals and professional books, and
    attend teachers institutes or conventions, besides supporting himself as a teacher
    ought to live. It does not need argument to show that this meager salary forces a
    standard of living too low for efficiency. It would, therefore, be unfair to ask for
    efficiency with the present standard of salaries.</p>
    <p>Nor is it to be overlooked that efficiency and salaries must mount upward
    together. It would be as unjust to ask for higher salaries without increasing the
    grade of efficiency as to ask for efficiency on the present salary basis. It is
    probable that the eighteen- or nineteen-year-old boys and girls starting in to teach
    the rural school, with but little preparation above the elementary grades, are
    receiving all they are worth, at least as compared with what they could earn in other
    lines. The great point of difficulty is that they are not worth enough. The community
    cannot afford to buy the kind of educational service they are qualified to offer; it
    would be a vastly better investment for the public to buy higher teaching efficiency
    at larger salaries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg
    112]</a></span></p>
    <p>No statistics are available to show the exact percentage of increase in rural
    teachers' salaries during recent years, but this increase has been considerable; and
    the tendency is still upward. In this as in other features of the rural school
    problem, however, it will be impossible to meet reasonable demands without forsaking
    the rural district system for a more centralized system of consolidated schools. To
    pay adequate salaries to the number of teachers now required for the thousands of
    small rural schools would be too heavy a drain on our economic resources. Under the
    consolidated system a considerably smaller number of teachers is required, and these
    can receive higher salaries without greatly increasing the amount expended for
    teaching. In this as in other phases of our educational problems, what is needed is
    rational business method, and a willingness to devote a fair proportion of our wealth
    to the education of the young.</p>
    <h4><i>Supervision of rural teaching</i></h4>
    <p>Our rural school teaching has never had efficient supervision. The very nature of
    rural school organization has rendered expert supervision impossible, no matter how
    able the supervising officer might be. With slight modifications, the<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> office of
    <i>county superintendent</i> is, throughout the country, typical of the attempt to
    provide supervision for the rural school. While such a system may have afforded all
    that could be expected in the pioneer days, its inadequacy to meet present-day
    demands is almost too patent to require discussion.</p>
    <p>First of all, it is physically impossible for a county superintendent to visit and
    supervise one hundred and fifty teachers at work in as many different schools
    scattered over four or five hundred square miles of territory. If he were to devote
    all his time to visiting country schools, he would have only one day to each school
    per year. When it is remembered that the county superintendent must also attend to an
    office that has a large amount of correspondence and clerical work, that he is
    usually commissioned with authority to oversee the building of all schoolhouses in
    his county, that he must act as judge in hearing appeals in school disputes, that he
    must conduct all teachers' examinations and in many instances grade the papers, and,
    finally, that country roads are often impassable, it is seen that his time for
    supervision is greatly curtailed. As a matter of fact some rural schools receive no
    visit from the county superintendent for several years at a time.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
    <p>A still further obstacle comes from the fact of the frequent changes of teachers
    among rural schools. A teacher visited by the county superintendent in a certain
    school this term, and advised as to how best to meet its problems, is likely to be in
    a different school next term, and required to meet an entirely new set of
    problems.</p>
    <p>This is all very different from the problem of supervision met by the town or city
    superintendent. For the town or city district is of small area, and the schools few
    and close together. If the number of teachers is large, the superintendent is
    assisted by principals of different schools, and by deputies. The teaching force is
    better prepared, and hence requires less close supervision. School standards are
    higher, and the co&ouml;peration of patrons more easily secured. The course of study
    is better organized, the schools better graded and equipped, and all other conditions
    more favorable to efficient supervision. It would not, therefore, be just to compare
    the results of supervision in the country districts with those in urban schools
    without making full allowance for these fundamental differences.</p>
    <p>The county superintendent is in many States discriminated against in salary as
    compared with other county officers, and, as a rule, no provision<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> is made to
    compensate for traveling expenses incurred in visiting schools. This, in effect,
    places a financial penalty on the work of supervision, as the superintendent can
    remain in his office with considerably less expense to himself than when he is out
    among the schools. In some instances, however, an allowance is made for traveling
    expenses in addition to the regular salary, thus encouraging the visiting of schools,
    or at least removing the handicap existing under the older system. An attempt has
    also been made in some States to relieve the county superintendent of the greater
    part of the clerical work of his office by employing for him at county expense a
    clerk for this purpose. These two provisions have proved of great help to the
    supervisory function of the county superintendent's work, but the task yet looms up
    in impossible magnitude.</p>
    <p>The county superintendency is throughout the country almost universally a
    political office. In some States, as, for example, in Indiana, it is appointive by a
    non-partisan board. But, in general, the candidate of the prevailing party, or the
    one who is the best "mixer," secures the office regardless of qualifications. Sharing
    the fortunes of other political offices, the county superintendency frequently has
    applied to it the unwritten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg
    116]</a></span> party rule of "two terms and out," thus crippling the efficiency of
    the office by frequent changes of administration and uncertainty of tenure.</p>
    <p>No fixed educational or professional standard of preparation for the county
    superintendency exists in the different States. If some reasonably high standard were
    required, it would do much to lessen the mischievous effects of making it a political
    office. In a large proportion of cases the county superintendent is only required to
    hold a middle-class certificate, and has enjoyed no better educational facilities
    than dozens of the teachers he is to supervise. The author has conducted teachers'
    institutes in the Middle West for county superintendents who had never attended an
    institute or taught a term of school. The salary and professional opportunities of
    the office are not sufficiently attractive to draw men from the better school
    positions; hence the great majority of county superintendents come from the village
    principalships, the grades of town schools, or even from the rural schools.</p>
    <p>A marked tendency of recent years has been to elect women as county
    superintendents. In Iowa, for example, half of the present county superintendents are
    women, and the proportion is increasing. In not a few instances women have<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> made exceptional
    records as county superintendents, and, as a whole, are loyally devoted to their
    work. They suffer one disadvantage in this office, however, which is hard to
    overcome: they find it impossible, without undue exposure, to travel about the county
    during the cold and stormy weather of winter or when the roads are soaked with the
    spring rains. Whether they will be able to effect the desired co&ouml;rdination
    between the rural school and the agricultural interests of the community is a
    question yet to be settled.</p>
    <p>In spite of the limitations of the office of county superintendent, however, it
    must not be thought that this office has played an unimportant part in our
    educational development. It has exerted a marked influence in the upbuilding of our
    schools, and accomplished this under the most unfavorable and discouraging
    circumstances. Among its occupants have been some of the most able and efficient men
    and women engaged in our school system. But the time has come in our educational
    advancement when the rural schools should have better supervision than they are now
    getting or can get under the present system.</p>
    <p>The first step in improving the supervision, as in improving so many other
    features of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg
    118]</a></span> rural schools, is the reorganization of the system through
    consolidation, and the consequent reduction in the number of schools to be
    supervised. The next step is to remove the supervising office as far as possible from
    "practical" politics by making it appointive by a non-partisan county board, who will
    be at liberty to go anywhere for a superintendent, who will be glad to pay a good
    salary, and who will seek to retain a superintendent in office as long as he is
    rendering acceptable service to the county. The third step is to raise the standard
    of fitness for the office so that the incumbent may be a true intellectual leader
    among the teachers and people of his county. Nor can this preparation be of the
    scholastic type alone, but must be of such character as to adapt its possessor to the
    spirit and ideals of an agricultural people.</p>
    <p>A wholly efficient system of supervision of rural teaching, then, would be
    possible only in a system of consolidated schools, each under the immediate direction
    of a principal, himself thoroughly educated and especially qualified to carry on the
    work of a school adapted to rural needs. Over these schools would be the supervision
    of the county superintendent, who will stand in the same relation to the principals
    as that of the city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg
    119]</a></span> superintendent to his ward or high school principals. The county
    superintendent will serve to unify and correlate the work of the different
    consolidated schools, and to relate all to the life and work of the farm.</p>
    <p>If it is said that systems of superintendence for rural schools could be devised
    more effective than the county superintendency, this may be granted as a matter of
    theory; but as a practical working program, there is no doubt that the office of
    county superintendent is a permanent part of our rural school system, unless the
    system itself is very radically changed. All the States, except the New England
    group, Ohio, and Nevada, now have the office of county superintendent. It is likely,
    therefore, that the plan of district superintendence permissive under the laws of
    certain States will hardly secure wide acceptance. The county as the unit of school
    administration is growing in favor, and will probably ultimately come to characterize
    the rural school system. The most natural step lying next ahead would, therefore,
    seem to be to make the conditions surrounding the office of county superintendent as
    favorable as possible, and then give the superintendent a sufficient number of
    deputies to make the supervision effective. These<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> deputies should be selected, of
    course, with reference to their fitness for supervising particular lines of teaching,
    such as primary, home economics, agriculture, etc. A beginning has already been made
    in the latter line by the employment in some counties, with the aid of the Federal
    Government, of an agricultural expert who not only instructs the farmers in their
    fields, but also correlates his work with the rural schools. This principle is
    capable of almost indefinite extension in our school system.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The editor and the publishers have most carefully planned this series to meet
      the needs of students of education in colleges and universities, in normal schools,
      and in teachers' training courses in high schools. The books will also be equally
      well adapted to teachers' reading circles and to the wide-awake, professionally
      ambitious superintendent and teacher. Each book presented in the series will embody
      the results of the latest research, and will be at the same time both
      scientifically accurate, and simple, clear, and interesting in style.</p>
      <p>The Riverside Textbooks in Education will eventually contain books on the
      following subjects:&mdash;</p>
      <p>1. History of Education.&mdash;2. Public Education in America.&mdash;3. Theory
      of Education.&mdash;4. Principles of Teaching.&mdash;5. School and Class
      Management.&mdash;6. School Hygiene.&mdash;7. School Administration.&mdash;8.
      Secondary Education.&mdash;9. Educational Psychology.&mdash;10. Educational
